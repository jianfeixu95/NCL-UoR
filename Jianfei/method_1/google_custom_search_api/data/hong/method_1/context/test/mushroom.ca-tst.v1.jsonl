It comprises a surface area of 13,462 square kilometres (5,198 sq mi).[3] In 2010, the overall city's population was 120,447 and 56,802 live within the city core. There are around 356,000 people in the metropolitan area in 2020. Yushu is the fourth largest city in Qinghai.\n\nThe city seat is the town of Gyêgu (also known as Yushu and Jiegu in Chinese), built in the valley of the Batang River, a right tributary of the Tongtian, which becomes the Jinsha at their confluence. All of these makeups part of the Yangtze watershed. In fact, almost the entire area of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is nomadic pastureland, except for Yushu city.\n\nYushu is one of the oldest towns in Qinghai,[citation needed] and has historically served as a major hub for regional trade.[4]: 116–117 It is situated at the crossroads of the important trade routes between Ya’an, Xining, and Lhasa.[citation needed] In the early days,[when?] Chinese traders brought tea bricks from Sichuan and transported them to other parts of the Tibetan regions such as Lhasa, Chamdo, and Golok, which were the best-known towns during that time.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the late 20th century, government officials encouraged traditionally nomadic merchants to settle down in Qinghai, including in Yushu, through measures such as low taxes and rents.[4]: 120 A 1995 research paper estimated that these merchants, which included many Hui traders of the Tibetan Plateau, comprised about one-third of Yushu's population.[4]: 120\n\nIn 2010, Yushu was severely impacted by an earthquake.[5] The earthquake destroyed many buildings in the city, and damaged many others.[5]\n\nWith an elevation of around 3,700 metres (12,100 ft), Yushu has an alpine subarctic climate (Köppen Dwc, Trewartha Eolo), with long, cold, very dry winters, and short, rainy, and mild summers. Average low temperatures are below freezing from early/mid-October to late April; however, due to the wide diurnal temperature variation, the average high never lowers to the freezing mark. Despite frequent rain during summer, when a majority of days sees rain, only June, the rainiest month, has less than 50% of possible sunshine; with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 49% in June to 66% in November, the city receives 2,496 hours of bright sunshine annually. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from −6.8 °C (19.8 °F) in January to 13.3 °C (55.9 °F) in July, while the annual mean is 3.75 °C (38.7 °F). About three-fourths of the annual precipitation of 482 mm (19.0 in) is delivered from June to September. The residents of Yushu City reported seeing a large meteor fireball falling from the sky into the horizon on December 23, 2020.[6]\n\nYushu comprises four subdistricts, two towns, and six townships.[10]\n\nDuring the late 20th century, government policy encouraged merchants throughout the region to settle down in Yushu.[4]: 120 A 1995 research paper estimated that these merchants, which included many Hui people, comprised about one-third of Yushu's population.[4]: 120\n\nThe city is served by the China National Highway 214 and the recently constructed (opened 2009) Yushu Batang Airport.\n\nThe city has a few monasteries in and around, it has also one mosque. Gyegu Monastery is located on the hill, while Thrangu Monastery and Domkar Monastery are located outside the city. There are also some famous religious sites such as the Wencheng Temple, the Gyanak Mani Stone Temple, and the King Gesar Museum. The Wencheng Temple is located 20 kilometers from the city center, while Gyanak Mani Temple is located 9 kilometers from the center. King Gesar Museum is located in the city center.\n\nThe city hosts a number of notable cultural festivals. Yushu is home to an annual horse racing festival, where Kham Tibetan warriors showcase their local culture.[12] The Yushu Horse Racing Festival is a traditional festival that is normally held at the end of July to the beginning of August, depending on the dates in the Tibetan calendar.[citation needed] The festival site is located on the lush summer grasslands of the valley floor, to make for better horse-racing events.[citation needed] Renowned as being the largest horse racing event in the Tibetan areas, the festival plays host to tens of thousands of Tibetans and tourists every year.[citation needed]\n\nThe festival features feats of horsemanship and horse racing that have been native to the plateau for over two thousand years, as well as horseback archery, tug-of-war, weightlifting, and many other local sports.[citation needed]New Faculty Q&A With Dr. Yushu Shi | Population Health Sciences: Dr. Yushu Shi is an assistant professor of population health sciences in the Division of Biostatistics. Before joining Weill Cornell Medicine, she was an assistant professor at the University of Missouri and a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nTell us about your research. As an applied biostatistician, my primary research goal is to facilitate data processing and interpretation to answer high-impact scientific questions. During graduate school, I worked on nonparametric Bayesian methods and survival analysis. In my postdoctoral training, I developed statistical methods for microbiome research, including unsupervised clustering of microbiome samples and feature identification in supervised and unsupervised learning. Microbiome data is unique in high-dimensional and next-generational sequencing data and comes with phylogenetic information. In my work, I incorporate phylogenetic information in identifying features that drive clustering and determine outcomes.\n\nAt WCM, I am closer to leaders in the medical field than I’ve previously been, whether they are biologists, epidemiologists, or clinicians. Their input informs my work and allows me to better develop my research methods.\n\nIn both my graduate and postdoctoral training, I have served as a statistician for several clinical projects. With my statistical and computational background, I improve existing data analyses with robust and powerful quantitative approaches. I’m also experienced in and continuing to learn about emerging omics data structures and corresponding statistical analysis pipelines. These enable and enhance the quality of new scientific discoveries. In the era of big data, I enjoy collaborating with biomedical researchers and aim to answer real-world questions with statistical rigor.\n\nWhat brings you to Weill Cornell Medicine? Being at WCM offers the opportunity to work on clinically relevant problems and collaborate with leaders in the statistical and biomedical fields. The interdisciplinary environment facilitates diverse collaborations and innovative ideas. Partnerships with institutes like NewYork-Presbyterian, Rockefeller University, and the Sloan Kettering Institute allow me to keep up with cutting-edge technology and high-impact scientific questions. I’m motivated to develop novel statistical and computational tools that advance biomedical research.\n\nI’m also passionate about teaching Biostatistics II for the WCM graduate programs. Even when students are not on a statistics-focused track, I’m able to demonstrate how statistics can benefit their work. As an instructor, I have the opportunity to grow and improve with each course I teach while training the next generation of statisticians or data scientists. Are there any trends or issues you are currently following in your field?\n\nMy current research focuses on feature selection for high-dimensional data with false discovery control. I enjoy developing easy-to-use data visualization and manipulation tools, such as the R package and R Shiny apps. I am currently developing an R Shiny app that can visualize survival outcomes through a 2D contour plot and a tool for conducting conditional association tests for microbiome data with phylogenetic tree information. Given my prior experience, I’ve continued to work on microbiome data analysis and nonparametric Bayesian methods.\n\nIn the future, I’d like to develop an advanced course on feature selection. It’s a subject that would require students to have some established knowledge, and it’s not typically offered as an independent course. I think it’s a valuable one to expand upon, and I’m excited to explore its potential as an educator."}

The album that followed, Employment, changed our lives and has soundtracked the lives of millions of others since 2005. In 2025 we are saluting 20 years of that album and everyone is invited. Come celebrate the 2000’s, loving everything less & less and stripey blazers taking over the world. See you all next year.Kaiser Chiefs - Wikipedia: Kaiser Chiefs are an English indie rock[1][3] band from Leeds who originally formed in 1996 as Runston Parva, before reforming as Parva in 2000, and releasing one studio album, 22, in 2003, before renaming and establishing themselves in their current name that same year. Since their formation, the band has consisted of lead vocalist Ricky Wilson, guitarist Andrew \"Whitey\" White, bassist Simon Rix, keyboardist Nick \"Peanut\" Baines and since 2013 drummer Vijay Mistry, who replaced founding drummer Nick Hodgson following his departure from the band in late 2012.[4]\n\nPrimarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s, the band has released eight original studio albums: Employment (2005), Yours Truly, Angry Mob (2007), Off with Their Heads (2008), The Future Is Medieval (2011), Education, Education, Education & War (2014), Stay Together (2016), Duck (2019), and Kaiser Chiefs' Easy Eighth Album (2024), one EP: Lap of Honour (2005), one compilation album: Souvenir: The Singles 2004–2012 (2012) and numerous singles, including the number one hit song \"Ruby\".\n\nTheir album Employment enjoyed critical and commercial success with over three million copies sold.[5] It has won the band three Brit Awards, including the award for Best British Group,[6] a NME award for Best Album,[7] and was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize.[8][9]\n\nTheir UK hit singles include 2004 and 2005 number 9 hit \"I Predict a Riot\", 2007 UK number 1 hit \"Ruby\", which has sold over 461,000 copies,[10] from their platinum album Yours Truly, Angry Mob plus a further two Top 20 singles in 2007 with \"The Angry Mob\" and \"Everything Is Average Nowadays\". Their singles \"Ruby\", \"I Predict a Riot\", \"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\", \"Never Miss a Beat\" and \"Oh My God\" had sold a combined total of 1.1 million up to August 2012.[10]\n\nWhen they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston, West Yorkshire.[11] After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, its name a deliberate misspelling of a small East Yorkshire hamlet called Ruston Parva. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university.\n\nParva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after Beggars Banquet closed the Mantra label, Parva were dropped and without any direction after the release of an album (22) and three singles (\"Heavy\", \"Good Bad Right Wrong\" and \"Hessles\").\n\nAccording to manager James Sandom in an interview with HitQuarters, as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, \"No one would touch them because they had a history. A lot of people used their history against them.\"[12] The band decided that they would aim for a longer-term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs. The new name was taken from South African football club Kaizer Chiefs, the first club of ex-Leeds United captain Lucas Radebe.[13]\n\nManager James Sandom was tipped off about the band by Drowned in Sound founder Sean Adams, who persuaded him to go and see them live. Sandom said: \"I went to see a couple of shows and you were just bombarded by a series of potential hit singles.\" Soon after Sandom became their manager, Kaiser Chiefs signed to B-Unique Records. Atlantic Records had also made an offer for the band.[12]\n\nIn July 2004, while still relatively unknown inside the UK, Kaiser Chiefs performed their first festival outside the UK at a festival in Moscow.[14] One of the major factors in the band's breakthrough in 2005 was their involvement in the NME Awards Tour at the beginning of the year.[15] Like Coldplay and Franz Ferdinand before them, their position as opening act proved an influential one, attracting a lot of positive media attention.[12]\n\nThe group's debut album Employment was released in March 2005, being primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s.[8] The album was well received by music critics, described as \"thrilling from beginning to end\" and \"quintessentially British, without pretension and most importantly, a whole lot of fun\".[16] It reached number two on the UK albums chart,[17] and was certified five times platinum.[18] In 2005, Employment was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best British or Irish album from the previous year. Bookmakers made it favourite to win the award, but they eventually lost out to Antony and the Johnsons.[9] In 2006, Employment won the Ivor Novello award for 'Best Album'[19]\n\nThe first single released from the album was \"Oh My God\" in 2004, which reached number six on the UK singles chart when it was reissued in February 2005. In 2007, the song was covered by Mark Ronson and Lily Allen for Ronson's album Version. \"I Predict a Riot\" soon followed as the album's second release. In 2007, the song was ranked number thirty-six on the NME \"Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\" countdown.[20] The top twenty singles \"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\" and \"Modern Way\" followed in late 2005. The band opened and performed several of their singles at the Philadelphia Live Eight concert in 2005. The song \"Saturday Night\" was featured in a pre-release video for the Xbox 360 gaming console. It was posted on the official Xbox 360 page before its launch.\n\nIn 2006, the band received NME awards for 'Best Album' for Employment and 'Best Dressed' for Ricky Wilson.[15]\n\nKaiser Chiefs' second album Yours Truly, Angry Mob was released in February 2007. The group recorded the album throughout the September and October 2006 at Hookend Recording Studios in Oxfordshire, England. The group took inspiration from Led Zeppelin and American rock music, and recorded over twenty-two songs.[21]\n\nYours Truly, Angry Mob reached number one on the UK albums chart and number forty-five on the Billboard 200 albums chart.[22] The album went on to be the band's second Million Seller including the UK and European #1 Airplay Hit of 2007 \"Ruby\".[23]\n\n\"Ruby\", the album's lead single, became Kaiser Chiefs' first UK number one single[24] and received the 2007 'Q Award' for 'Best Video'.[25] \"Everything Is Average Nowadays\" was released as the album's second single, and reached No. 19 in the UK.[26] The album's third single \"The Angry Mob\" peaked at number twenty-two in the UK.[27][28] The fourth single, \"Love's Not a Competition (But I'm Winning)\", was released on 12 November as a collector's edition 7\" only single via their website.\n\nIn December 2007, Kaiser Chiefs played two sold-out shows at Earl's Court in London[29] to a capacity crowd of 30,000.[30]\n\nOn 4 August 2008, the band confirmed the name of their third album as Off with Their Heads. It was released on 20 October 2008. The first single \"Never Miss a Beat\" was released on 6 October 2008.[31]\n\nThe band also released a DVD of their live performance at Elland Road from 24 May where they played to a sold out capacity crowd of 40,000 people.[32] The DVD contains the full set from the home of Leeds United as well as highlights from the Kaiser Chiefs performance for the 2007 BBC Electric Proms.\n\nKaiser Chiefs set out on a UK tour in October 2008 with Castle Donington band Late of the Pier and The Hair. The tour started at Leeds Academy, a new venue where they were the first headlining band to play. Other dates included Manchester Academy, Southampton Guildhall, Reading Rivermead, Glasgow Barrowlands, Leicester De Montfort Hall and London Forum.[citation needed]\n\nKaiser Chiefs headed out on a UK Arena tour between February and March 2009, kicking off in Nottingham and ending in London. The tour visited Sheffield, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Dublin. This was the new album tour to promote Off with Their Heads. The band featured on several shows over Christmas 2008 including performing \"Never Miss a Beat\" with Girls Aloud on their TV Special and playing the same song on the Christmas Day edition of Top of the Pops.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, they played at Marés Vivas in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal as headliners on that day. They, along with Republic of Loose, opened for U2 in Croke Park in Dublin on 25 July 2009. They then opened for Green Day from 27 July to 7 August 2009, and the final shows before their 2-year hiatus were performed at Reading and Leeds Festival 2009.[33]\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Kaiser Chiefs announced that they expected to release their fourth studio album in mid-2011. The album was recorded over a period of eighteen months at various locations including drummer Nick Hodgson's self-built east-London studio.[34] The album's producers included Tony Visconti, Ethan Johns and Owen Morris, in addition to Nick Hodgson himself.[35] On 3 June 2011, Kaiser Chiefs launched their new album from their website. Using a create-your-own album technique, fans were able to choose 10 out of 20 songs to create \"their album\" for £7.50; the band provides streams of roughly one minute to preview each track before selection. Many celebrities including, Radio One DJ Chris Moyles, The Guardian Newspaper, and frontman Ricky Wilson, created their own version of the album, donating the £1 reimbursement for each copy sold to the Alzheimer's Society.[36]\n\nOn 27 June 2011, Kaiser Chiefs released an official track listing for the album, featuring 12 of the 20 available tracks and including a previously unheard track 'Kinda Girl You Are' which did not make the initial launch as it was not ready in time.[37] They played two sell out comeback gigs at Falmouth Princess Pavilion. Then followed by appearances at Germany's Hurricane and Southside Festivals in June, Switzerland's Gurten Festival, Pinkpop in The Netherlands, Belgium's Rock Werchter, Portuguese festival Optimus Alive! in July, V Festival in August, Hard Rock Calling in June, the Isle of Wight Festival in June and at Terres Rouges Festival in Luxembourg in September. They also played at Tennants Vital in Bangor, Northern Ireland and in September they played two sold-out home town shows at Kirkstall Abbey in Leeds. They also be played in October in Festa das Latas, Coimbra – Portugal.\n\nOn 6 March 2012 the album was re-released under the title Start The Revolution Without Me for the US market. The track list differs significantly from the initial release, including the track \"On The Run\", which is exclusive to the US album and served as its lead single in early 2012.[38]\n\nIn early 2012, Kaiser Chiefs played a 20 date tour of the United Kingdom, followed by a tour of North America.[38][39]\n\nKaiser Chiefs released their first compilation album, Souvenir: The Singles 2004–2012, in the UK on 4 June 2012. The album features all of the singles released by the band from 2004 to 2012, as well as a new track titled \"Listen to Your Head\".\n\nDrummer Nick Hodgson announced on 4 December 2012 that he had left the band to concentrate on other projects.[4][40] The band later issued a statement on their website confirming this.[41] On 7 February 2013 it was announced that Vijay Mistry from the band Club Smith would be joining the Kaiser Chiefs as their new drummer.[42]\n\nThe band were one of two support bands for Green Day's one-off concert at the Emirates Stadium in London on 1 June 2013 along with All Time Low. The band's UK tour included 13 shows, beginning at Carlisle Sands Centre on 11 February and ending at London's O2 Academy Brixton on 1 March. The run of shows also includes gigs in Glasgow, Dunfermline, Manchester, Bridlington, Newcastle, Preston, Cheltenham, Wolverhampton, Southampton, Margate and Cambridge. They then went on to headline one of the Eden Sessions at the Eden Project, Cornwall. They played a hometown concert at the First Direct Arena in September 2013, being one of the first artists to perform at the new venue.[43]\n\nThe band's fifth studio album, titled Education, Education, Education & War was released on 31 March 2014.[44] Education, Education, Education & War is the first album featuring the new Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Vijay Mistry, after Nick Hodgson left the group in December 2012.[45] The album was produced by Ben H. Allen III (who has previously worked with Gnarls Barkley, Animal Collective, and Deerhunter), and recorded at The Maze Studio in Atlanta. Three songs were co-written with Fraser T Smith (CeeLo Green, Adele).[46][47] It was mixed by Michael Brauer (My Morning Jacket, Coldplay) at Electric Lady Studios in New York City in November 2013.[48] On 5 December 2013, Kaiser Chiefs released a song titled \"Misery Company\" onto their SoundCloud account. The song had previously been performed live during the band's 2013 summer tour.[45][49] On 3 January 2014, \"Bows & Arrows\" premiered on Rolling Stone magazine's website.\n\nEducation, Education, Education & War was toured across Europe and the Americas throughout 2014 and 2015.\n\nIn 2015, they supported the Foo Fighters during the South Africa, South America and Ireland legs of their Sonic Highways World Tour. They also released stand alone single 'Falling Awake' on 27 January 2015 via their YouTube channel.\n\nStay Together, the band's sixth studio album, was released on 7 October 2016. It was co-written and produced by Brian Higgins, whose production company Xenomania has worked with the likes of Girls Aloud and Pet Shop Boys. The album's name is a reference to the song \"We Stay Together\".[50][51] The first single from the album, \"Parachute\", was released on 14 June 2016. The second single, \"Hole In My Soul\" was released 18 August 2016 and the third and final single, \"We Stay Together\" was released on 9 December 2016.\n\nThis welcome return to the limelight saw ‘Stay Together’ push new boundaries to \"take this nondescript sound and stuff it impressively full of sing-a-long hooks, covering topics including monogamy (We Stay Together) and shagging (Good Clean Fun)\" as it marked an entirely new direction for the band, who went for a more dance-oriented sound.[52] While Education, Education, Education and War was more focused on politics and the perils of war, the Kaiser Chiefs made the album with a focus on love and relationships. Wilson elaborated further on the stark contrast between this last album and 'Stay Together': \"The thing about writing a protest album is it's straightforward. Only an idiot would disagree with you. You're just saying war is bad. But when you start talking about relationships like on this record it's harder because there's a lot more blurred line. There's no right or wrong.\"[53]\n\nThe band performed a string of best of forest shows in the summer of 2016 as part the Forestry Commission's Forest Live series. Stay Together was toured across Europe in early 2017.\n\nThe band signed with their original label Polydor Records for their seventh studio album, Duck, which released on 26 July 2019. For the album the band reunited with Ben H. Allen, the producer who worked on the band's 2014 album Education, Education, Education & War. The album was preceded by a UK tour in January and February, including concerts at London's O2 Academy Brixton and O2 Academy Birmingham, where several new songs from the album were premiered. The band also played a homecoming show at Elland Road in Leeds on 8 June 2019, which was also to celebrate 100 years of Leeds United.[54]\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Record Collection\", was released on 23 May 2019, with \"People Know How To Love One Another\" released as a second single on 6 June 2019. \"Golden Oldies\" was released as the third single in October 2019. The album entered at number three in the UK album charts.[55] Duck was later toured around arenas in the UK and Europe in early 2020, with all further touring cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn October 2022, the band announced the single \"How 2 Dance\", the first for V2 Records, which was released on 4 November. The song is part of their eighth album, Kaiser Chiefs' Easy Eighth Album,[56] produced by Nile Rodgers and Amir Amor.[57] The second single, \"Jealousy\", was released on 11 April 2023.[58] The third single, \"Feeling Alright\", was released on 25 October 2023.[59] The album was released on March 1, 2024.\n\nIn July 2005 they were chosen to open Bob Geldof's Live 8 festival in Philadelphia; their performance was broadcast by satellite to every Live 8 venue around the world, giving the band massive worldwide exposure.\n\nIn August 2006, the band released a book entitled A Record of Employment, which along with photos by Peter Hill, documented the band's rise from being unsigned to their triumph at the Brit Awards that year, where the band won awards for 'Best British Band', 'Best Rock Act' and 'Best New Artist'. Later a DVD entitled Enjoyment, which documented concerts from the first album era was released, this showed members of the band hypothetically interviewed when 'jaded rock stars'.\n\nIn October 2008, they also appeared on MTV Day, in Greece, along with bands like the (Greek) C-Real, R.E.M. and the singer Gabriella Cilmi.[60]\n\nDuring an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, David Letterman spoke to Nick Hodgson about buying the Kaiser Chiefs drum set after a brief discussion between the pair an undisclosed price was agreed. At the end of the Kaiser Chiefs show at Chicago's House of Blues (19 April 2012) Nick Hodgson announced this was the final show for his drum kit, which was to be sent to David Letterman.\n\nOn 12 August 2012, the band was featured in the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, playing \"Pinball Wizard\" by The Who.\n\nIn October 2014, Kaiser Chiefs played at The New Adelphi Club in Hull, East Yorkshire as headline act for the venue's 30th anniversary celebration.[61] A film capturing Kaiser Chiefs performance was made, which was shown at the Adelphi in January 2015 as part of Independent Music Venue Week. In October 2015, the film was screened at the 2015 Tucson Film & Music Festival in Arizona, United States.[62]\n\nThe band were the closing act for F1 Live (an event showcasing Formula 1 ahead of the 2017 British Grand Prix) held in Trafalgar Square, London on 12 July 2017, which was also broadcast live on Sky Sports.\n\nIn September 2022, Kaiser Chiefs headlined Pub in The Park in St Albans.[63]\n• Off with Their Heads (2008)\n• Off With Their Heads Tour (2008-2009)Kaiser Chiefs: Almost two decades in the game, and an extensive back-catalogue of stadium belters, instrumental-prowess, and record-breaking success, Kaiser Chiefs triumphantly return. Right off the back of a storm of note-worthy live-performances (including the Invictus Games opening ceremony, headlining Virgin Radio’s: One Big Thank You key worker show, and a televised performance for ITV’s Queen’s Jubilee celebrations), Kaiser Chiefs release their latest single: ‘How 2 Dance; the first taste of their forthcoming new album which promises to not only see us through the end of this year, but launch fans into 2023 with impeccable swagger, and heritage songwriting. “We really wanted to make a song that put together all the things we were trying to get right over the last three records”, notes frontman Ricky Wilson. “The call to arms of ‘Education, Education, Education and War’ (2014), the party atmosphere of ‘Stay Together’ (2016), and the classic Kaiser-yness of ‘Duck’. Where 2019’s ‘Duck’ straddled the tide between Northern-Soul euphoria and early ‘00s antithesis (in a statement of melancholic perfection), 2022 see’s Kaiser Chiefs stepping into a renewed spotlight; a hook-heightened universe in which Wilson (vocals), Andrew “Whitey” White (guitar), Simon Rix (bass), Keyboardist Peanut and Vijay Mistry on drums, come together to once again create what they craft best; breakthrough belters for the world’s dancefloor.Reddit - Dive into anything: By continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy."}

En ese país la incidencia de enfermedades cardiovasculares es mucho menor a comparación de otros países desarrollados, aunque siguen una dieta más rica en grasas saturadas.\n\nEl irlandés Samuel Black, observador y amante de la cultura y la buena mesa gala, publicó en 1819 un artículo científico en el que hizo la siguiente observación: «Los franceses comen una gran cantidad de grasas -quesos, otros derivados de la leche completa y foie gras- y en general tienen menos ataques al corazón que los ingleses y otros europeos». Al final del artículo Black dejó entrever que el consumo de vino tinto podía tener alguna participación en el asunto.\n\nHa habido varias interpretaciones del hecho. En 1991, un programa de televisión de la cadena estadounidense CBS (60 minutos) aseguró que se debía a las propiedades del vino tinto, y eso hizo que se dispararan las ventas de vino tinto en aquel país. Desde entonces este fenómeno se lo conoce como paradoja francesa.[1]​ Por su parte, Paul Bocuse lo explicaba por la gran calidad de los foies y las carnes que consumen, junto con el vino. Estudios recientes apuntan al efecto del consumo de aceite de oliva con alto contenido en ácido oleico y otros ingredientes típicos de la llamada dieta mediterránea.[2]​\n\nDe una parte parece claro que un consumo moderado de alcohol, especialmente de vino (que contiene resveratrol, polifenoles y flavonoides), es beneficioso para la salud [cita requerida], si bien los estudios más recientes concluyen que no hay relación entre el consumo de grasa saturada y las enfermedades cardiovasculares[3]​[4]​[5]​[6]​[7]​ y en todo caso podría ser al revés,[8]​ si bien otros factores podrían ser un aumento del consumo de vegetales y reducción del consumo de hidratos de carbono. Aparte de todo esto, se ha visto recientemente que el contenido de vitamina K2 MK-4 presente en los quesos franceses podría ser una de las explicaciones de esta paradoja.[9]​ [10]​\n\nLa idea de que las grasas saturadas son perjudiciales, se remontan a un estudio realizado en 1950 por Ancel Keys, que se ha demostrado intencionadamente falso.[11]​\n• El vino no siempre es perjudicial La paradoja francesa CONSUMER.ES\n• En defensa de las grasas\n• La falacia de la dieta mediterránea y la importancia del individuoNuevas explicaciones de la paradoja francesa: la metabolómica del queso | Sociedad Española de Dietética y Ciencias de la Alimentación (S.E.D.C.A.): En Madrid, los días 11 y 12 de marzo de 2025 tendrá lugar nuestro XVIII Congreso Internacional organ¿Qué hay de la paradoja francesa?: La denominada “paradoja francesa” es un término acuñado en los ochenta por tres hombres franceses para explicar un hallazgo peculiar. Si pones en un gráfico los casos de muerte causados por ataques del corazón y la cantidad de grasa saturada y colesterol que se consume en distintos países, pareces obtener a una línea recta. Cuantos más alimentos derivados de animales se consuman, más aumenta la tasa de mortalidad. En cambio, tal vez si logramos disminuir el consumo de carne, huevos y lácteos lo suficiente podríamos bajar las tasas de mortalidad por enfermedades coronarias a cero.\n\nComo dije en mi video ¿Cómo explicar la paradoja francesa?, dos países no se encontraban en la línea recta que mencioné. Finlandia parecía tener peores resultados de lo esperado, y Francia parecía tener mejores resultados de lo esperado. De ahí que se hable de la existencia de esta paradoja. ¿Cómo es posible que Francia tenga un consumo de grasa saturada y colesterol similar al de Finlandia, pero cinco veces menos ataques al corazón fatales?\n\nTodos tenían sus teorías favoritas para explicar la paradoja. ¿Era el vino? ¿Eran las cenas? Sí, los alimentos de origen animal estaban asociados con la mortalidad causada por enfermedades coronarias del corazón, pero los alimentos de origen vegetal parecían protectores. Así que, ¿tal vez el hecho de que los franceses comieran cuatro veces más vegetales ayuda a explicar sus bajas tasas de mortalidad?\n\nBueno, parece ser que no hay ninguna paradoja. Como Marion Nestle astutamente explicó, los franceses comenzaron a alimentarse de manera poco saludable muy recientemente y las enfermedades crónicas tardan décadas en desarrollarse. Los estadounidenses han estado comiendo así por más 40 años, mientras que los franceses apenas están empezando. Si todos comenzáramos a fumar hoy y no encontráramos un incremento significativo en el cáncer de pulmón mañana, eso no significaría que fumar no causa cáncer, solo que este necesita tiempo para desarrollarse.\n\n¿Qué pasa cuando se hacen los cálculos de verdad? Si se comparan la tasa de mortalidad por enfermedad coronaria contra la cantidad de grasa animal y los niveles de colesterol en esa época, se puede ver que Francia sí parecía estar excepcionalmente protegida. Y, si se comparan las tasas de mortalidad con lo que estaban comiendo dos décadas antes, siguen estando muy lejos de la línea recta. ¿Cómo es eso posible? Resulta que, de acuerdo a una investigación realizada por la Organización Mundial de la Salud, los doctores franceses registran hasta un 20% menos muertes causadas por enfermedades cardiacas isquémicas en los certificados de defunción de las que en realidad suceden.\n\nAsí que, teniendo esto en cuenta, Francia básicamente pasaría a situarse en la línea que relaciona la tasa de mortalidad con la grasa animal y el colesterol, con una tasa de ataques cardíacos fatales cuatro veces mayor que la de Japón décadas después de que aumentase cuatro veces el consumo de grasa animal.\n\nSi te estás haciendo preguntas sobre esos metaanálisis que muestran que la grasa saturada no está asociada con la enfermedad y pensaste que ya puedes comer mantequilla, lo has adivinado, tengo videos para ti: Los estudios de grasa saturada: ajustados para fallar y Estudios sobre grasa saturada: enmantecando al público.\n\n¿Y qué pasa con los estudios de la industria del huevo que afirman que el colesterol dietético es benigno?

Explica que las teorías más influyentes incluyen modelos de cambio de comportamiento, teoría del desarrollo de habilidades, teoría sociocognitiva, educación centrada en el alumno y modelo socioecológico. También analiza teorías de cambio de comportamiento como el modelo de creencias de salud y la teoría del comportamiento planificado, y cómo estas teorías pueden aplicarse para diseñar intervenciones nutricionales.Teorías y estrategias para el cambio de conducta en la alimentación: La atención de la salud y la nutrición están a la vanguardia de la medicina basada en la evidencia, demostrando que se puede medir la eficacia de las intervenciones nutricionales. El uso de bases teóricas para las intervenciones es clave para la comprensión y la medición de la eficacia. Se pueden hacer estudios controlados y aleatorizados en torno a las teorías que impulsan la selección de métodos de asesoría específicos o estrategias para lograr cambios muy personalizados. \n\n \n\n El asesoramiento nutricional es un proceso de apoyo para establecer prioridades y metas y crear planes de acción individualizados que reconocen y fomentan la responsabilidad del auto-cuidado. Los dietistas se ocupan a menudo del asesoramiento conductual relacionado con la nutrición, para facilitar el cambio de comportamiento. Para ser eficaces, los dietistas deberán tener conocimientos sobre la nutrición y las ciencias de la alimentación, la cocina étnicas y la cocinas regionales. Pueden proponer hipótesis y hacer ensayos controlados y aleatorizados y tienen experiencia práctica con la teoría basada en las estrategias para los cambios conductuales. Las teorías y los modelos validados dentro del campo de la dietética son un marco que ayuda a entender las cuestiones internas y externas y la dinámica que lleva a los cambios de conducta. El uso de estos marcos proporciona un fundamento para la selección de estrategias de asesoramiento específico para lograr un objetivo.\n\nLa teoría conductual y la teoría cognitivo-conductual (TCC) se basan en la suposición de que todo comportamiento es aprendido y que los factores ambientales e internos están relacionados con el comportamiento de cada uno. Las teorías apoyan las estrategias de auto-control y resolución de problemas, que hacen que las personas sean más concientes de los estímulos internos y externos y de sus respuestas. A las personas se les puede enseñar una variedad de estrategias para promover un cambio de comportamiento, incluyendo el auto-monitoreo, la resolución de problemas, la fijación de metas, el manejo de las contingencias, la reestructuración cognitiva, el apoyo social, el control de estímulos, el manejo del estrés y la prevención de las recaídas. El modelo transteórico describe el cambio de conducta en una serie de etapas y proporciona una base para el asesoramiento sobre estrategias correspondientes a las diferentes etapas del cambio. \n\n \n\n La teoría cognitiva social llama a construir la auto-eficacia (confianza en la propia capacidad para realizar una tarea específica), lo que influye en el esfuerzo que una persona está dispuesta a hacer para alcanzar un objetivo. Algunas de las estrategias cognitivas sociales aprobadas por la teoría son la imitación de los pares, el entrenamiento para desarrollar habilidades y el establecimiento de un conjunto de objetivos, los que refuerzan la autosuficiencia y la constancia de los esfuerzos por cambiar la conducta.\n\nEn el diseño y la aplicación de programas de asesoramiento nutricional como así de protocolos, el uso de teorías y modelos de cambio del comportamiento permiten a los dietistas aprovechar las estrategias aprobadas para mejorar la eficacia del asesoramiento. Las teorías del cambio de comportamiento constituyen el marco o fundamento para individualizar las intervenciones nutricionales de asesoramiento, para satisfacer las necesidades de las personas que tengan distintos grados de motivación, confianza, medio ambiente, apoyo y habilidades. \n\n \n\n La documentación regular del marco teórico y las estrategias utilizadas para el asesoramiento nutricional como parte del Proceso de Atención Nutricional, requerirá de los dietistas la aplicación de estrategias específicas para abordar los problemas de nutrición vinculados a los resultados específicos deseados. La adopción de registros o sistemas médicos electrónicos les permitirá evaluar los resultados del asesoramiento sobre diferentes estrategias para alcanzar los objetivos intermedios de tratamiento (por ej., aumento de la auto-eficacia o motivar al paciente para que pase de la precontemplación a la etapa de acción de cambio) y, definir las metas terapéuticas (por ej., pérdida de peso del 5% sostenida durante 1 año en todos los integrantes de la población atendida).\n\nEl proceso de incorporación de la atención nutricional centrado en el paciente incluye técnicas de asesoramiento para el cambio de comportamiento, que han demostrado ser efectivas para la prevención y el manejo de las enfermedades crónicas. Se ha demostrado que el asesoramiento nutricional brindado por dietistas mejora la pérdida de peso y su mantenimiento, la glucemia de los diabéticos tipo 2 y los factores de riesgo de enfermedad cardiovascular (ECV). Existe mucha evidencia que avala el uso de las TCC para facilitar los cambios de conducta destinados a reducir el riesgo de ECV, la prevención de la diabetes y la pérdida de peso. En la actualidad, hay evidencia relacionada con el uso del modelo transteórico en el contexto del cambio de la dieta. Esta teoría no solo ofrece estrategias apropiadas y validadas para favorecer el cambio de comportamiento, sino también permite la medición de los resultados principales (por ej., la disposición para el cambio de dieta), para evaluar el progreso de los pacientes no en las acciones de la etapa de cambio.\n\nLas construcciones, las variables y las estrategias relacionadas con la teoría cognitiva social (o teoría del aprendizaje social) se utilizan frecuentemente como parte de del asesoramiento dietético—por ej., demostraciones, capacitación de habilidades y testimonios. Se han validado muchas herramientas que miden el núcleo de las construcciones de esta teoría (por ej., la auto-eficacia y los resultados esperados) pero son pocos los estudios publicados sobre asesoramiento nutricional en este marco teórico. La obtención de más datos sobre esta teoría ayudará a determinar su valor potencial en la facilitación de los cambios de comportamiento relacionados con el marco.\n\nFinalmente, los autores expresan: “El uso rutinario y la documentación de las intervenciones basadas en la evidencia permitirán a los miembros de nuestra profesión a comprender mejor las complejidades del cambio de comportamiento nutricional y de las estrategias eficaces para ayudar a los pacientes a lograr los objetivos del cambio conductual.“\n\nDiversos grados de evidencia sostienen que el asesoramiento basado en la teoría produce cambios en materia de salud y alimentaria en adultos atendidos en un contexto ambulatorio o clínico.\n\n♦ Traducción y resumen objetivo: Dra.

He played for Dundee, Aberdeen, Manchester United, Leeds United and Coventry City, as well as the Scotland national team. He has since managed Coventry City, Southampton, Celtic, Middlesbrough and Scotland.\n\nIn club football, Strachan played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals, playing 21 of 25 career seasons in either the English or Scottish top-flight. In international football Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and played in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain 82 and Mexico 86. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.\n\nA right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup. Moving to England, Strachan won the 1985 FA Cup final in five seasons with Manchester United. He spent the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989–90 Second Division and 1991–92 First Division league titles. He played his last game for Scotland in 1992. He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach.\n\nStrachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup final, where they lost 1–0 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title. He then became manager of Middlesbrough in the English Championship, but left the club after an unsuccessful 12 months in the job. Strachan then managed the Scotland national team for five years, but was unable to secure qualification for a major tournament.\n\nStrachan was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the 1990–91 season while at Leeds. He was also named Manager of the Year in Scotland several times by writers and players while at Celtic. In 2007, Strachan was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. He is the father of Craig Strachan and Gavin Strachan and the grandfather of Luke Strachan, all of whom were also footballers.\n\nStrachan was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1993 New Year Honours for services to association football.[4]\n\nBorn and raised in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Strachan supported Hibernian as a boy.[5][6] His father, Jim, worked as a scaffolder, and his mother, Catherine, worked at a whisky distillery.[7] At age 15, he damaged his vision playing football on the school playground when a pen in his pocket became lodged in his right eye; the pen came within \"a thousandth of an inch\" of permanently costing him the vision in his eye.[8] He was offered a contract by Hibernian manager Eddie Turnbull, but his father decided against the offer after stating the club did not pay sufficient expenses for footwear.[9]\n\nStrachan began his career with Dundee, having decided to sign with the Scottish club at age 14.[9] In joining the club, he rejected an approach from Manchester United,[6] reasoning he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at Dens Park.[9] His natural talent was immediately apparent, and he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award.[6] He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly with Arsenal in August 1975;[6] The Sunday Post compared him to a young Billy Bremner.[10] Strachan became a regular player in the 1975–76 season, the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, featuring in 17 of the club's 36 league matches;[11] however, David White's \"Dee\" were relegated on the last day of the season after rivals Dundee United edged ahead on goal average with an unlikely draw with champions Rangers.[12]\n\nNew boss Tommy Gemmell handed 19-year-old Strachan the captaincy for the 1976–77 First Division campaign,[13] and he remains the youngest player to have captained Dundee.[6] Strachan considers his performance as captain as very poor. \"I was a pathetic Billy Bremner. I wanted to go about bumping into people, growling at people, shouting at people. And I forgot to be a footballer.\"[14] The club failed to shine in the lower divisions, and Strachan lost his first-team place early in the 1977–78 season following a drinking session with Jimmy Johnstone; Gemmell was also concerned that Strachan was \"getting kicked a lot\" after opposition teams worked out that the way to stop Dundee was to take out their playmaker.[15] Strachan decided to leave Dundee as the club seemed unlikely to win back their top-flight status; the Dundee chairman was also keen on cashing in his most prized asset, and told Gemmell that \"we need £50,000 by Friday or the banks are closing the gate\".[6][16] His last match for Dundee was on 26 October 1977 in a 6–0 defeat in the League Cup to Queen of the South at Palmerston Park, which Strachan described in his autobiography as \"embarrassing\".\n\nStrachan was signed by Aberdeen manager Billy McNeill in November 1977 for a fee of £50,000 plus Jim Shirra.[16] Poor form and niggling injuries made 1977–78 a poor season for Strachan, though the \"Dons\" went on to finish second in the Scottish Premier Division. He was not picked for the 1978 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Rangers.[17] Strachan did win the Scottish 2nd XI Cup with the reserves in 1978.[18]\n\nMcNeill left the Pittodrie Stadium for Celtic in summer 1978, and Alex Ferguson was appointed as the new manager.[19] Strachan played at Hampden Park in the 1979 League Cup defeat to Rangers, and set up Duncan Davidson for the game's opening goal.[20] Though the 1978–79 campaign was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in 1979–80 after closing a ten-point deficit over Celtic with a late run that included two victories at Celtic Park.[21] They again reached the League Cup Final, beating both Old Firm sides en route, where they lost 3–0 to Dundee United at Dens Park.[22] At the end of the season, Strachan was elected SFWA Footballer of the Year.[6][23] After gaining assurance Alex McLeish would also stay with the club, Strachan signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.[24]\n\nThe \"Reds\" could only manage a second-place finish in 1980–81, as Celtic regained the league title. They exited the European Cup in the second round with defeat to eventual champions Liverpool; manager Bob Paisley said Strachan would become \"Britain's first £2 million player\", in what was a (successful) early attempt at mind games.[25] He missed the second half of the season with a muscle tear in his stomach.[26] With fit-again Strachan on the right flank – supported by full-back Stuart Kennedy – and record signing Peter Weir on the left-flank, Aberdeen mounted a genuine title challenge in 1981–82, but had to settle for second place to Celtic.[27] They did though lift the Scottish Cup with a 4–1 extra-time victory over Rangers, with Strachan contributing one assist and one goal.[28]\n\nThe 1982–83 campaign was the greatest in the history of the club, and Strachan made his mark early on with four goals in a 5–1 victory at former club Dundee in the League Cup.[29] Despite only finishing third in the league (albeit only one point behind champions and New Firm rivals Dundee United) and exiting the League Cup in the quarter-finals, Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's European success came with a 2–1 after-extra-time victory over Spanish giants Real Madrid at Ullevi in Gothenburg. The Scottish Cup came with a 1–0 win over Rangers.[30] The \"Dons\" continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in 1983–84, with Strachan setting up Mark McGhee for the winning goal in the cup final win over Celtic.[31] This completed a unique treble, as they defeated Hamburger SV in the 1983 European Super Cup.\n\nIn August 1984, Manchester United spent £500,000 to take Strachan to Old Trafford.[32] However, because Strachan had previously signed a pre-contract agreement with Bundesliga side 1. FC Köln, United paid £75,000 compensation to resolve the row – teammate Mark McGhee had also signed a contract with Hamburger SV on the understanding that Strachan would also be playing in Germany.[33] Strachan opened the 1984–85 campaign with four goals in seven matches,[34] though the \"Red Devils\" could only manage a fourth-place finish in the First Division. He featured at Wembley Stadium in the 1985 FA Cup Final, as United ran out 1–0 winners over Everton; his lung-bursting run off-the-ball helped Norman Whiteside to find the space for his extra-time winner.[35]\n\nAfter winning their opening ten league matches of the 1985–86 season, United had to cope without Strachan, who was sidelined for much of the season with injury.[36] They proved unable to cope with their injuries – another key player facing extended time in the treatment room was Bryan Robson – and limped to another fourth-place finish.[36] Atkinson was replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, and Strachan mocked sobbing as he told his teammates, \"I never thought he'd follow me this far south!\"[37] After his arrival, Ferguson speculated that no longer being the star player had negatively affected Strachan's form.[38] United finished a disappointing 11th in 1986–87, before rising to second place in 1987–88. Strachan's form was again patchy in 1988–89, as United slipped back down to 11th.[39]\n\nIn March 1989, Sheffield Wednesday manager Ron Atkinson had a bid of £200,000 accepted by Manchester United, and he offered Strachan a contract paying more money than anyone in the club's history.[40] However likely a move to Sheffield seemed, Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson matched the offer and convinced Strachan to drop down into the Second Division.[41] He quickly became a popular figure at Elland Road, earning comparisons to former favourites Bobby Collins and Johnny Giles.[42] Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain's armband.[43] He formed an unlikely midfield partnership with Vinnie Jones and led the club to the Second Division title in 1989–90.[44]\n\nWith the \"Whites\" now in the First Division, Wilkinson secured a midfield quartet of Strachan, Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gary Speed.[45] They achieved a commendable fourth-place finish in 1990–91, and also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup.[45] Strachan was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances during the campaign, becoming the first player to win the award both in Scotland and in England.[45]\n\nStrachan signed a new two-year contract, before captaining Leeds to the league title in 1991–92.[46] In so doing, he denied former boss Alex Ferguson and Leeds' hated rivals Manchester United the title.[47] However, Strachan (now nearing age 35) was beginning to feel the effects of his sciatica and missed a number of matches due to his bad back.[48] Following the club's success, Strachan was appointed an OBE for his services to sport.[49]\n\nHowever, Leeds were unable to build on their success, and finished the 1992–93 season down in 17th place in what was newly re-branded as the Premier League.[50] Strachan continued to impress though, and was given the club's Player of the Year award.[50] He scored a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on 10 April 1993.[51] This was his second hat-trick for Leeds, the first having come in September 1989 when he found the net three times in a 4–0 win over promotion rivals Swindon Town in the Second Division at Elland Road.[52]\n\nStrachan managed 37 starts in 1993–94, and Leeds rose to fifth.[50] He was rarely selected in the 1994–95 season, which would prove to be the end of his spell at Elland Road, where he had spent six years.[53]\n\nIn March 1995, Strachan moved to Coventry City to work as assistant manager under new manager Ron Atkinson, the man who had brought him south of the border to Manchester United 11 years earlier. It was also agreed he would replace Atkinson as manager in summer 1997.[54] Strachan coached the team and led training sessions while learning the finer points of management from Atkinson.[55] He also took to the field at Highfield Road, playing 26 Premier League matches for the Sky Blues over the next two years before finally hanging up his boots in his 40th year. Atkinson signed Aberdeen midfielder Eoin Jess in 1996 purely on the basis of Strachan's recommendation.[56] However, Isaías left the club after falling-out with Strachan.[57] Coventry signed Gary McAllister for £3 million on wages of £20,000 per week; the deal was done by McAllister's former teammate and friend Strachan, while Atkinson was largely opposed to the deal.[58] The club struggled at the start of the 1996–97 campaign, and the club's board of directors asked Atkinson to step aside in November 1996, some months earlier than first agreed, and Strachan was appointed manager.[59]\n\nStrachan won his first cap for Scotland on 16 May 1980, in a British Home Championship defeat to Northern Ireland at Windsor Park.[60] Strachan helped Scotland qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and scored a crucial goal in qualifying by scoring the only goal against Sweden at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm.[61] He did not feature in the 1982 British Home Championship, as Jock Stein wanted to rest him for the World Cup, held in Spain.[62] The Scots cruised to a 5–2 victory over New Zealand at La Rosaleda Stadium, Málaga; Strachan was named Man of the Match.[63] Scotland then lost 4–1 to a world-class Brazil side at the Estadio Benito Villamarín, Seville.[64] In the third match, a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union back in Málaga saw Scotland exit the tournament on goal difference.[64]\n\nScotland also qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. However, shortly after the draw with Wales at Ninian Park on 10 September 1985, Jock Stein died of a heart attack, and his assistant Alex Ferguson took charge for the World Cup campaign.[65] To complete their qualification, they had to beat Australia in a play-off. Strachan played in the first leg at Hampden Park, but did not travel to Melbourne for the second leg.[66] The Scots faced a tough draw in Mexico and lost their opening match 1–0 at the Estadio Neza 86 in the Mexico City suburb of Nezahualcóyotl to the unseeded – but highly fancied – Denmark.[67] Strachan then scored in a 2–1 defeat to West Germany at the Estadio Corregidora in Queretaro; his goal celebration was memorable, as he tried to climb the advertising hoardings, but was thwarted by his short stature and so merely rested his leg on the hoarding before he was joined by his teammates.[68] In the third and final group match back in Nezahualcóyotl, Scotland drew 0–0 with Uruguay despite their opponents going down to ten men after less than a minute of play when José Batista attempted to take Strachan out of the game.[68]\n\nStrachan fell out of the first team picture under Andy Roxburgh, and was omitted from the squad for the 1990 World Cup.[69] Nevertheless, he enjoyed a national team revival between 1990 and 1992, and captained his country in qualification for UEFA Euro 1992.[70] However, he did not travel to Sweden as a member of the squad, as he announced his retirement due to long-term back troubles.[71] He won 50 full caps, and scored five international goals.\n\nWhen Ron Atkinson became Coventry City's director of football in November 1996, Strachan was promoted to a player manager position. He appointed Alex Miller as his assistant.[72] After an upturn in results, Strachan was named Manager of the Month in December.[73] However, 1 win in 12 matches in the New Year left the \"Sky Blues\" in the relegation zone. Late wins over Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur saved their season though, and relegation was avoided by a one-point margin. Strachan played in the win over Chelsea at Highfield Road at age 40, in what was at the time a record age for an outfield player in the Premier League.[citation needed]\n\nStrachan signed Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman and defender Roland Nilsson, Dutch midfielder George Boateng, and Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan – all of whom would win international caps.[74] Coventry rose to 11th place in 1997–98, and also reached the quarter-finals of the 1997–98 FA Cup.[74] After Miller left the club, Strachan replaced him with Garry Pendrey, who would go on to spend many years as his assistant at various clubs.[75] Strachan was again named Manager of the Month in February 1998.[citation needed]\n\nThe club finished 15th in 1998–99 and 14th in 1999–2000, as Strachan spent £6 million on Irish striker Robbie Keane and £5 million on Moroccans Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, while selling Dion Dublin to Midlands rivals Aston Villa.[76] Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season, making Strachan unpopular with fans.[77] New signing Craig Bellamy proved disappointing, while Robbie Keane was sold and Gary McAllister departed for Liverpool.[78] Strachan attempted to launch a promotion campaign by signing striker Lee Hughes, but in the face of increasing supporter unrest, he was sacked five matches into the 2001–02 First Division campaign.[79] His replacement, Roland Nilsson, took the club to an 11th-place finish.[citation needed]\n\nStrachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager's job at Premier League Southampton, who had sacked manager Stuart Gray after a terrible start to their first season at the new St Mary's Stadium. Most pundits had already written off their survival chances by the time of Strachan's appointment in October 2001, but he turned round their fortunes and they finished 11th in the Premier League. The Saints progressed further in 2002–03 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup Final, where they lost 1–0 to Arsenal. As Arsenal had already qualified for the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, Southampton won a place in the UEFA Cup.[80]\n\nIn February 2004, Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager after his decision not to stay on at the club in the summer was leaked to the press.[81] He wanted to take a break from football, but was forced to resign earlier than initially intended due to the speculation surrounding his and the club's future following the leak.[82]\n\nAfter a 16-month break, Strachan returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O'Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). For 2005–06, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title from rivals Rangers. He had an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager, losing 5–0 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and three days later, drawing 4–4 with Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. The loss against Artmedia meant Celtic suffered an early exit from European competition, despite winning the return match 4–0. After this disastrous start, Celtic started to improve under Strachan. A low-point was the shock defeat in the third round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they defeated Dunfermline Athletic 8–1, a record victory margin for the SPL at the time. Strachan's first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time and with six matches remaining. Reflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted Manager of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers' Association eight days later.[83]\n\nThe following year, Strachan restructured the team and made a series of signings, bringing in players such as Hibernian's Derek Riordan; Chelsea's Jiří Jarošík; Kenny Miller and Lee Naylor from Wolverhampton Wanderers; Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink from PSV; Thomas Gravesen from Real Madrid; and Paul Hartley and Steven Pressley from Hearts. Celtic flourished and by mid-January 2007 held a 17-point lead in the SPL table. UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside Benfica, Copenhagen and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993. Celtic lost their round of 16 tie against eventual winners Milan in extra time, missing out on a place in the quarter-finals. On 22 April 2007, Strachan guided Celtic to their 41st league championship, and second in succession. A 2–1 victory against Kilmarnock[84] left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Later that day, Strachan was recognised as the inaugural PFA Scotland Manager of the Year for 2007. Celtic went on to win the Scottish Cup, beating Dunfermline Athletic.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, Strachan led Celtic into the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League again after defeating Milan, Benfica and Shakhtar Donetsk. By April, there was significant criticism from the press and the fans after a 1–0 loss to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and a 1–0 loss to ten-man Motherwell in the SPL. However, after defeating Rangers twice at home, on 22 May 2008 Strachan became only the third ever Celtic manager to guide the club to three consecutive Scottish league titles.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, after winning the League Cup after extra time against Rangers, but failing to lead Celtic to another league title, he resigned as manager on 25 May 2009.[85][86]\n\nStrachan signed a four-year contract with English Championship team Middlesbrough on 26 October 2009, succeeding Gareth Southgate.[87][88] He had been linked with the Middlesbrough manager's job 15 years earlier, when still a Leeds United player.[89] His first match in charge was on 31 October, a 1–0 defeat to Plymouth Argyle, with Adam Johnson missing a penalty.[90] On 5 December, Middlesbrough won their first match under Strachan, 5–1 away to Queens Park Rangers.[91] After a poor run of results, including a 3–0 loss at home to Blackpool and a 1–0 loss at home to Cardiff City, Strachan earned his first home win after his team beat Scunthorpe United 3–0.[92]\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2010–11 season meant Middlesbrough were in 20th place,[93] Strachan left the club by mutual consent on 18 October.[94] He voluntarily ended his contract and left without compensation.[93]\n\nStrachan was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on 15 January 2013, succeeding Craig Levein.[95] His first match in charge was at Pittodrie Stadium in a friendly match against Estonia on 6 February. The game ended 1–0 to Scotland, with Charlie Mulgrew getting his first international goal. Scotland suffered defeats to Wales and Serbia in Strachan's first two competitive matches, which ended the Scots' slim chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup.[96] After this, Scotland had an upturn in form, winning both matches against Croatia[96] and away against Macedonia. Scotland finished fourth in qualifying Group A.\n\nIn Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24, but were drawn in a tough group with Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland.[96] After losing their opening match in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, Ireland and Gibraltar, and away draws against Poland and Ireland.[96] In their following match, Scotland produced an \"insipid\" performance, as they lost 1–0 in Georgia.[96] A home defeat by Germany left Scotland four points behind third-placed Ireland, with two matches to play.[96] In the penultimate matches of the group, Scotland needed to beat Poland, or hope that Ireland would lose to Germany.[96] Scotland came from behind to lead 2–1 in their match, but Ireland had scored the only goal of their match, leaving the Scots needing a win to stay alive.[96] A late scrambled goal by Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a draw that eliminated Scotland from contention.[96] Strachan bemoaned what he perceived to be bad luck.[96] After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed to a new contract with the Scottish Football Association.[97] After failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Strachan resigned from his position on 12 October 2017.[98]\n\nTypically playing a traditional 4–4–2 formation,[99][100][101] and very occasionally 4–5–1,[99][102] Strachan is widely known for his rigorous management style,[103][better source needed] and states that he watches video replays of his club's matches two or sometimes three times.[104] He also places great emphasis on player health and fitness, forbidding his players to drink alcohol excessively or regularly, and often giving dietary advice to his players, attributing his own longevity as a player to a strict and somewhat unusual diet involving seaweed.[105][106] Players such as Scotland international Gary Caldwell have attributed their success at Celtic to lifestyle changes enforced by Strachan.[107]\n\nRenowned for his deadpan humour in media interviews, quotes attributed to Strachan have become part of popular football culture.[108][109]\n\nDespite playing for Alex Ferguson at two clubs, the pair had an ongoing public feud during Strachan's managerial career. In his 1999 autobiography, the former Manchester United manager said, \"I decided this man could not be trusted an inch – I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry.\" In his own 2006 autobiography, in response to Ferguson's comments, Strachan said he was \"surprised and disappointed\".[110] The rivalry dates from Strachan's time playing under Ferguson, first at Aberdeen and later Manchester United.[111] In August 2006, after his Celtic team was drawn to play Ferguson's Manchester United in the Champions League, Strachan said that there was no longer any enmity between the two managers.[112]\n\nStrachan has analysed football matches for the media, including alongside Adrian Chiles on BBC Sport's Match of the Day 2.[113] He has worked as a regular pundit for ITV's coverage of the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. During the 2014 World Cup, he worked as a pundit for ITV.[114] In April 2019, Strachan apologised for remarks he made during The Debate on Sky Sports.[115] Following the release of convicted sex offender Adam Johnson from prison, Strachan had appeared to suggest that abusing Johnson for that offence was comparable with racial abuse.[115]\n\nFor the 2006 World Cup, Strachan was appointed as the official FIFA Ambassador for Scotland, joining 50 others in fundraising for SOS Children's Villages, the official charity of the tournament.[116]\n\nStrachan and his two sons started their own football school in the Coventry area in August 2009.[117]\n\nIn July 2019, Strachan was appointed to a technical director position with Dundee.[118]\n\nStrachan married Lesley Scott in 1977; George Mackie was his best man.[119] Together, they had three children: Craig and Gavin Strachan, also footballers,[117] and Gemma Strachan.[120] Strachan's grandson, Luke, is also a footballer and came through the youth setup with Dundee whilst Gordon was technical director at the club.[121]\n• PFA Team of the Year Second Division: 1989–90\n• PFA Team of the Year First Division: 1990–91Gordon Strachan - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Gordon David Strachan /ˈɡɔrdən ˈdeɪvɪd ˈstrɑːxən/ (Edimburgo, Escocia, 9 de febrero de 1957) es un exfutbolista y entrenador escocés.

He was born June 7, 1929 in Cleveland, Oh, a son of the late Alexander William and Margaret (Watt) Strachan and was also preceded in death by his wife... View Obituary & Service InformationGordon C. Strachan (White House Special Files: Staff Member and Office Files) | Richard Nixon Museum and Library: Gordon C. Strachan, a California-born lawyer in Nixon's old New York law firm, came to Washington in August 1970 to join the Nixon White House staff. His former college classmate, Dwight L. Chapin, who was the President's appointments secretary, recruited Strachan for a White House position. Strachan was, however, already acquainted with several Nixon aides from his college days at the University of Southern California and from his intermittent advance work during the 1970 congressional campaigns.\n\nHis first assignment at the White House was staff assistant to Herbert G. Klein, Director of Communications for the Executive Branch. It seemed he was filling a vacancy on Klein's staff that was created by the departure of James Hogue. There is in Strachan's files two folders of what appear to be Hogue's chronological files for the period March-July 1970. Although Strachan was hired as a staff assistant to Klein, he worked primarily under the supervision of Jeb S. Magruder, deputy director of communications, who reported directly to Klein and White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman.\n\nStrachan's most important daily assignment was overseeing the liaison work with the public information officers at various departments and agencies. Strachan personally handled liaison with departments of Commerce and Labor, Office of Economic Opportunity, and Peace Corps. Although he had been initially assigned responsibilities with the offices of Emergency Preparedness, Army Corps of Engineers, Nixon's science adviser Lee A. DuBridge, and those promoting voluntary service, his file folders on these topics are empty. The liaison work required daily contact with the appropriate public information officers, and in some instances Strachan was expected to maintain morning and afternoon telephone contacts with particular departments and agencies. Strachan's handwritten notes indicate the extent of these daily contacts. He was also required to prepare weekly and monthly reports on the activities of his assigned departments and agencies.\n\nAlthough Strachan had functional duties as staff assistant in the communications office, he had been initially recruited to be what was called project manager. In his testimony before the Ervin Committee, Strachan described the specialized duties of a project manager. Specific issues of varying degrees of importance to the administration were assigned to one senior White House staffer and one junior staff member to devise the best strategy for communicating to the public various Presidential and administration activities or programs. For example, during the 1970 midterm elections the state of the economy became a major campaign issue. Strachan and White House speech writer William L. Safire were assigned to the economy issue as a project–Strachan as the junior staff assistant and Safire as the senior person. They reported to Haldeman through Magruder on the alleged high cost of congressional spending. The titles of the folders in Strachan's files indicate the topics of other projects on which he worked: Vietnam, State of the Union address, B-52 casualty figures, Honor America Day, SST, inflation, polling, the Indian occupation of Alcatraz, Presidential vetoes, political advertising, and selected legislation.\n\nAs a project manager, it was Strachan's responsibility to develop so-called game plans for a particular event or issue from all the ideas furnished by interested staffers or offices. The general format of these tentative plans included a description of the event or issue, the desired objective, and a proposed course of action. Strachan would thus outline the possible steps the administration might take in dealing with a particular event or issue, and then, using the game plan as a working document, prepare a follow-up memorandum based on his annotations to the original game plan. In addition to this, it was his responsibility as the project manager to make certain that the plan was carried out as agreed by Haldeman and other senior staffers.\n\nStrachan's files also revealed his involvement in the mailings operation which the communications office was becoming increasingly more active. Klein and his staff felt a need to improve the dissemination of information from the White House to the public, because they realized not every news organization could afford to maintain a correspondent in Washington nor belong to one of the major wire services. Consequently, the communications office began to mail out fact sheets or background materials on specific issues to editorial writers, publishers, news media directors, and other influential groups for their use. As the operation began to expand in size and scope, the staff realized that it could not be handled within the White House and so turned to the Republican National Committee (RNC) for assistance. To insure the proper coordination between the White House and RNC, Strachan was assigned the task of liaison. He made certain that the lists were periodically updated and that the most effective groups received a complete set of mail listings. Strachan was also instrumental in expanding the mailings list to include select groups of individual voters, such as blue-collar workers, educators, farmers, and various ethnic groups. Although the content of the mailings varied greatly, the objective remained always the same–to foster and mold public opinion in support of the President and his policies and programs.\n\nAn offshoot to the mailings operation was a letters-to-the-editor project. Under Magruder's guidance, a White House letter-writing campaign was established around single issues, such as law and order, media bias, welfare reform, campus violence, integration, select legistation, and political candidates. Since the RNC had the facilities and ample manpower to handle the details, it took on the job and supplied the writers and other support services for the White House. Strachan, acting as the White House Liaison, provided the proper supervisory coordination for the project.\n\nStrachan worked for Klein until after the 1970 elections. Once these elections were concluded, key senior White House staff members immediately began to turn their attention to planning for the 1972 Presidential campaign. An indication of this shift in outlook was a reshuffling of personnel within the White House staff, and Strachan was one of those Nixon aides affected. By March 1971 he was working as a staff assistant on Haldeman's staff, handling all projects in the political area. Although Strachan told the Ervin Committee he worked in Klein's shop until the end of December 1970, his chronological files as a staff assistant to Klein end at the beginning of March 1971.\n\nOther material related to Gordon Strachan are in Haldeman's Staff Member and Office Files within the White House Special Files. These files include, as a readily identifiable body of materials, Strachan's chronological files. These particular files, comprising 3.6 cubic feet, date from March 1971 to December 1972, when he left Haldeman's staff to assume the duties of general counsel at the United States Information Agency.\n\nThe materials are arranged into one series:LAFC: LAFC has announced its 2025 preseason schedule with five matches beginning on Jan. 20 with a closed-door friendly against Calgary FC of the Canadian Premier League.

UU.; en inglés: United States o US),[nota 3]​ denominado oficialmente Estados Unidos de América (EUA; en inglés: United States of America o USA)[13]​ es un país soberano constituido en una república federal constitucional compuesta por cincuenta estados y un distrito federal. Limita al norte con Canadá y al sur, con México. Su capital es Washington D. C. y su ciudad más poblada, Nueva York. La mayor parte del país se ubica en el medio de América del Norte ―donde se encuentran sus 48 estados contiguos y Washington D. C.―, entre los océanos Pacífico y Atlántico.\n\nEl estado de Alaska está en el noroeste del continente, limita con Canadá al este, separado de Rusia al oeste por el estrecho de Bering. El estado de Hawái es un archipiélago polinesio ubicado en Oceanía, en medio del océano Pacífico y es el único de sus estados que no se encuentra en América.\n\nEl país posee en el mar Caribe dos territorios no incorporados, el estado libre asociado de Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes, en el Pacífico otros territorios no incorporados, y a diferencia de estos últimos, un «territorio incorporado no organizado»: el atolón Palmyra.\n\nCon 9.83 millones de kilómetros cuadrados,[5]​ y con más de 340 millones de habitantes, el país está en el cuarto puesto por superficie total, en el quinto por superficie contigua y en el tercer por población. Es una de las naciones con más diversidad de etnias y culturas, producto de la inmigración a gran escala.[14]​\n\nEs la economía nacional más grande del mundo en términos nominales, con un PIB estimado en 22.6 billones de dólares (una cuarta parte del PIB global nominal) y una quinta parte del PIB global en paridad de poder adquisitivo.[9]​ El país es la principal fuerza capitalista del planeta, además de ser líder en la investigación científica y la innovación tecnológica desde el siglo XIX y, desde comienzos del siglo XX, el principal país industrial. En PIB PPA, Estados Unidos es la segunda economía más grande, por detrás de la China.[15]​\n\nEl territorio continental estadounidense estuvo habitado por diversos grupos indígenas durante miles de años. Esta población aborigen fue reducida por las enfermedades y la guerra, después del primer contacto con los europeos. Estados Unidos fue fundado por trece colonias británicas, a lo largo de la costa atlántica. El 4 de julio de 1776, emitieron la Declaración de Independencia, que proclamó su derecho a la libre autodeterminación y el establecimiento de una unión cooperativa. Los estados rebeldes derrotaron al Imperio británico en la guerra de independencia, el primer conflicto bélico colonial exitoso de carácter independentista. ​ La Constitución de los Estados Unidos fue adoptada el 17 de septiembre de 1787; su ratificación al año siguiente hizo a los estados parte de una sola república con un gobierno central fuerte. La Carta de Derechos, que comprende diez enmiendas constitucionales que garantizan muchos derechos civiles fundamentales y las libertades, fue ratificada en 1791.\n\nEn el siglo XIX, los Estados Unidos adquirieron territorios de Francia, España, Reino Unido, México, Rusia y Japón, además de anexionarse las repúblicas de Florida, Texas, California y Hawái. En la década de 1860, las disputas entre el sur agrario y conservador y el norte industrial y progresista sobre los derechos de los estados y la abolición de la esclavitud provocaron la Guerra de Secesión. La victoria del norte evitó una división permanente del país y condujo al final de la esclavitud legal. Para la década de 1890, la economía nacional era la más grande del mundo[17]​ y la guerra hispano-estadounidense y la Primera Guerra Mundial confirmaron su estatus como una potencia militar. Después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, surgió como el primer país con armas nucleares y miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas.\n\nDurante la Guerra Fría, Estados Unidos luchó en la guerra de Corea y la guerra de Vietnam, pero evitó el conflicto militar directo con la Unión Soviética. Las dos superpotencias compitieron en la Carrera Espacial, que culminó en el vuelo espacial de 1969 que llevó a los humanos a la Luna por primera vez. El final de la Guerra Fría y la disolución de la URSS la dejaron como la única superpotencia internacional. En el siglo XXI, los atentados del 11-S dieron lugar a la denominada guerra contra el terrorismo, y el ascenso de China y el regreso de Rusia conducen a una Nueva Guerra Fría, mientras que eventos como la crisis económica de 2008, la elección de Donald Trump como presidente en 2016 o las protestas por la muerte de George Floyd en 2020 provocaron tensiones sociales internas.\n\nEl país representa dos quintas partes del gasto militar mundial y es una fuerza económica, política y cultural, líder en el mundo.[18]​[19]​\n\nEn 1507, el cartógrafo alemán Martin Waldseemüller elaboró un planisferio en el que llamó a las tierras del hemisferio occidental «América», en honor al explorador y cartógrafo italiano Américo Vespucio.[20]​ Las antiguas colonias británicas utilizaron por primera vez el nombre del país moderno en la Declaración de Independencia, la «unánime declaración de los trece Estados Unidos de la América» adoptada por los «representantes de los Estados Unidos de América», 4 de julio de 1776.[21]​ El nombre actual se determinó el 15 de noviembre de 1777, cuando el Segundo Congreso Continental aprobó los Artículos de la Confederación, que estipulan, «El nombre de esta Confederación será “Los Estados Unidos de América”». «Columbia», un nombre una vez popular para los Estados Unidos, se deriva del nombre de Cristóbal Colón y aún permanece en el nombre del distrito de Columbia. Ocasionalmente se le llama, de forma incorrecta, «Estados Unidos de Norteamérica», derivando en una confusión en su gentilicio.\n\nLa manera estándar para referirse a un ciudadano de los Estados Unidos son los términos estadounidense (o estadunidense en Honduras y México).[13]​ También se utilizan gringo y yanqui, que pueden o no tener un matiz despectivo, según el uso, el contexto y el tono de la voz.[22]​ A veces se utiliza «norteamericano» como sinónimo de «estadounidense», pero se debe tener presente que la región de Norteamérica está formada por Canadá, Estados Unidos y la mayor parte de México, hasta el istmo de Tehuantepec. Debe evitarse el gentilicio «americano» para referirse exclusivamente a los naturales de los Estados Unidos[13]​ debido a que esta palabra engloba a todos los habitantes del continente americano. Por esta razón, el gentilicio recomendado es la palabra «estadounidense». Para escribir abreviadamente el nombre de este país suelen emplearse, de manera correcta, la abreviatura «EE. UU.» (Estados Unidos),[23]​ o la sigla «EUA» (Estados Unidos de América). Aunque frecuente, en español es incorrecto emplear la sigla anglosajona «USA».[13]​\n\nComúnmente se piensa que los pueblos indígenas de los Estados Unidos continentales, incluyendo a los nativos de Alaska, emigraron desde Asia entre doce mil y cuarenta mil años atrás.[24]​ Algunos, tales como la cultura misisipiana, desarrollaron una agricultura avanzada, grandes obras arquitectónicas y sociedades con un orden jerárquico. Después de que los europeos comenzaran a asentarse en América, hubo una acusada disminución de la población indígena debido a las epidemias de enfermedades traídas desde Europa, como la viruela.[25]​\n\nEn 1492, el navegante Cristóbal Colón, en su proyecto de circunnavegar hasta Asia, patrocinado por la Corona Española, llegó desde España hasta las islas del Caribe, realizando el primer contacto con los pueblos indígenas del Nuevo Mundo. El 2 de abril de 1513, el conquistador español Juan Ponce de León desembarcó en lo que llamó La Florida, siendo la primera llegada europea documentada en el territorio estadounidense. Los asentamientos españoles en la región fueron seguidos por otros en el actual suroeste de Estados Unidos. Los comerciantes de pieles franceses se establecieron en Nueva Francia, alrededor de la zona de los Grandes Lagos; finalmente Francia reclamaría gran parte del interior de Estados Unidos, hasta la costa del golfo de México. Los primeros asentamientos ingleses exitosos fueron la colonia de Virginia en Jamestown en 1607 y la colonia de Plymouth fundada por peregrinos en 1620. En 1628, el establecimiento de la provincia de la bahía de Massachusetts dio lugar a una nueva ola de inmigración: para 1634, Nueva Inglaterra estaba habitada por cerca de diez mil puritanos. Entre la década de 1610 y la guerra de independencia, cerca de cincuenta mil convictos fueron enviados desde el Viejo Continente hacia las colonias.[26]​ Desde 1614, los neerlandeses se establecieron a lo largo del río Hudson inferior, fundando Nueva Ámsterdam en la isla de Manhattan.\n\nEn 1674, los Países Bajos cedieron su territorio a Inglaterra y la provincia de los Nuevos Países Bajos fue renombrada con el nombre de Nueva York, convertida en la ciudad más importante de los Estados Unidos desde mediados del siglo XIX. Muchos inmigrantes recién llegados, especialmente en el sur, fueron contratados como criados, de tal modo que cerca de dos tercios de todos los inmigrantes que llegaron a Virginia entre 1630 y 1680 trabajaban como sirvientes. ​ Para finales de ese siglo, los esclavos africanos se convirtieron en la principal fuente de mano de obra en condiciones de servidumbre. Con la división de las Carolinas en 1729 y la colonización de Georgia en 1732, se establecieron las Trece Colonias británicas, que finalmente se convertirían en los Estados Unidos de América. Todas contaban con un gobierno local electo, apegado al republicanismo, además de que se legalizó el comercio de esclavos. Con altas tasas de nacimiento, bajas tasas de mortalidad y la constante inmigración, la población colonial creció rápidamente. El movimiento cristiano revivalista de las décadas de 1730 y 1740, conocido como «el Gran Despertar», alimentó el interés en temas como la religión y la libertad de culto. En la guerra franco-india, las fuerzas británicas le arrebataron Canadá a Francia, pero la población de habla francesa permaneció políticamente aislada de las colonias del sur. Sin contar a los nativos americanos (popularmente conocidos como «indios») que finalmente fueron desplazados en contra de su voluntad, en 1770 las Trece colonias tenían una población de 2.6 millones de habitantes, alrededor de una tercera parte de la del Reino Unido, aunque casi uno de cada cinco estadounidenses era un esclavo negro. ​ Sin embargo, los colonos estadounidenses no tenían ninguna representación en el Parlamento del Reino Unido.\n\nLas tensiones entre los colonos y los británicos durante las décadas de 1760 y 1770 condujeron a la Guerra de Independencia, que se extendió desde 1775 hasta 1781. El 14 de junio de 1775, el Congreso Continental, reunido en Filadelfia, estableció un Ejército Continental bajo el mando de George Washington. Proclamando que «todos los hombres nacen iguales» y dotados de «ciertos derechos inalienables», el Congreso aprobó la Declaración de Independencia, redactada en gran parte por Thomas Jefferson, el 4 de julio de 1776.[29]​ Anualmente, en esta fecha se celebra el Día de la Independencia de los Estados Unidos. Así, Estados Unidos se convirtió en la primera nación americana en declarar su independencia. En 1777, los artículos de la Confederación establecieron un débil gobierno confederal, que operó hasta 1789.\n\nDespués de la derrota británica por las fuerzas estadounidenses, asistidas por franceses y españoles, el Reino Unido reconoció su independencia y soberanía sobre el territorio al este del río Misisipi. Una convención constitucional fue organizada en 1787 por aquellos que deseaban establecer un gobierno nacional fuerte. La Constitución de los Estados Unidos fue ratificada en 1788 y un año más tarde, George Washington se convirtió en el primer presidente. La Carta de Derechos, que prohibía la restricción federal de los derechos humanos y garantizaba una serie de medidas para su protección jurídica, fue adoptada en 1791.[30]​\n\nCon la nueva autonomía, las actitudes hacia la esclavitud fueron cambiando; una cláusula en la Constitución protegió el comercio de esclavos hasta 1808. Los estados del norte abolieron la esclavitud entre 1780 y 1804, dejando a los estados esclavistas del sur como defensores de la «institución peculiar». El «Segundo Gran Despertar», que comenzó alrededor de 1800, convirtió a las Iglesias evangélicas en una de las principales fuerzas detrás de varios de los movimientos reformistas de la época, incluyendo el abolicionismo.[31]​\n\nEn 1803, la compra de la Luisiana a Francia durante el mandato del presidente Thomas Jefferson, casi duplicó el tamaño de la nación,[32]​ al mismo tiempo que la guerra anglo-estadounidense de 1812 fortaleció aún más el nacionalismo entre la población. Derrotado por el Reino Unido y tras su segunda y definitiva abdicación al trono francés en 1815, Napoleón Bonaparte intentó escapar a Estados Unidos, entonces rival del Reino Unido, pero fue capturado por las fuerzas británicas y deportado a Santa Helena. En 1819, una serie de incursiones militares en Florida obligó a España a ceder este y otros territorios de la costa del golfo.[32]​ El sendero de lágrimas en la década de 1830 ejemplifica la política de Remoción India que despojó a varios pueblos indígenas de sus tierras. Estados Unidos se anexó la República de Texas en 1845, época durante la cual el concepto del Destino Manifiesto se popularizó. ​ En 1846, la firma del Tratado de Oregón con el Reino Unido, le otorgó al país los actuales territorios del noroeste.[32]​ Dos años más tarde, la victoria en la guerra contra México dio lugar a la cesión de California y la mayor parte del suroeste actual.[32]​ La fiebre del oro de 1848 y 1849 estimuló aún más la migración hacia el oeste y los nuevos ferrocarriles facilitaron la reubicación de los colonos y el aumento de los conflictos con los nativos americanos. Durante medio siglo, hasta 40 millones de bisontes americanos fueron sacrificados por sus pieles y carne para facilitar la propagación de los ferrocarriles. La pérdida de los búfalos, una fuente principal de alimento para los indígenas de las llanuras, fue un golpe mortal para muchas culturas nativas.[34]​\n\nLas tensiones entre estados pro-esclavistas y los abolicionistas, junto al aumento de los desacuerdos en la relación entre el gobierno federal y estatal, provocaron conflictos violentos por causa de la expansión de la esclavitud hacia los nuevos territorios. Abraham Lincoln, candidato del Partido Republicano y un gran abolicionista, fue elegido presidente en 1860. Antes de que tomase posesión de su cargo, seis estados esclavistas declararon su secesión de la Unión, formando los Estados Confederados de América, si bien otros estados también esclavistas permanecieron leales a la Unión.[35]​ El gobierno federal declaró que la secesión era ilegal y pronto se produjo el ataque por parte de los secesionistas a Fort Sumter, iniciándose así la guerra civil estadounidense el 12 de abril de 1861.[36]​\n\nTras la victoria de la Unión el 9 de abril de 1865, se añadieron tres enmiendas a la constitución para garantizar la libertad de los casi 4 millones de afroamericanos que habían sido esclavos, convirtiéndolos en ciudadanos y dándoles el derecho de voto.[37]​ La guerra y su resolución dio lugar a un aumento sustancial de las competencias del gobierno federal. ​\n\nDespués del asesinato de Abraham Lincoln, tuvo lugar la época conocida como la Reconstrucción, en la cual se desarrollaron políticas encaminadas a la reintegración y la reconstrucción de los estados sureños garantizando al mismo tiempo los derechos de los nuevos esclavos liberados. Las controvertidas elecciones presidenciales de 1876 se resolvieron mediante el Compromiso de 1877, por el cual los demócratas sureños reconocieron como presidente a Rutherford B. Hayes a cambio de que este retirara las tropas que aún permanecían desplegadas en Luisiana, Carolina del Sur y Florida. A partir de 1876 empiezan a aplicarse las llamadas leyes de Jim Crow, una política de apartheid que perduraría hasta 1965.[39]​ La Masacre de Wounded Knee en 1890 fue el último conflicto armado en la larga guerra con los pueblos originarios.[40]​\n\nEn el norte, la urbanización sin precedentes y una afluencia de inmigrantes aceleró la industrialización del país. La ola de la inmigración, que duró hasta 1929, proporcionó mano de obra para los negocios, transformado a su vez la cultura. La alta protección arancelaria, la creación de infraestructuras nacionales y los nuevos reglamentos bancarios alentaron el crecimiento industrial. En 1867, se produce la compra de Alaska a Rusia, completando la expansión continental del país.[32]​ La masacre de Wounded Knee en 1890 fue el último gran conflicto armado contra los nativos indios americanos. En 1893, la monarquía indígena del Reino de Hawái fue derrocada en un golpe de Estado liderado por ciudadanos estadounidenses; el archipiélago fue anexado al país en 1898.[32]​ La victoria en la guerra hispano-estadounidense ese mismo año, demostró que Estados Unidos era una potencia mundial y dio lugar a la ocupación de Cuba y la anexión de Puerto Rico y las Filipinas.[41]​ Filipinas accedió a la independencia en 1946, mientras que Puerto Rico continúa siendo un Estado libre asociado.\n\nAl estallar la Primera Guerra Mundial en Europa en 1914, Estados Unidos se declaró neutral. Posteriormente, los estadounidenses se solidarizaron con los británicos y franceses, a pesar de que muchos ciudadanos, sobre todo los originarios de Irlanda y Alemania, se opusieron a la intervención. ​ En 1917 se sumaron a los Aliados, contribuyendo a la derrota de las Potencias Centrales. Reacio a participar en asuntos europeos, el Senado no ratificó el Tratado de Versalles (1919), que estableció la Sociedad de Naciones, aplicando una política de unilateralismo, que rayaba en el aislacionismo. ​ En 1920, el movimiento de los derechos de la mujer ganó la aprobación de una enmienda constitucional para otorgar a las mujeres el sufragio.[30]​\n\nDurante la mayor parte de la década de 1920, el país gozó de un período de prosperidad, disminuyendo el desequilibrio de la balanza de pagos mientras crecían las ganancias de las granjas industriales. Este período, conocido como los felices años veinte, culminó en la crisis de 1929 que desencadenó la Gran Depresión. Después de su elección como presidente en 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt respondió con el New Deal (nuevo trato), una serie de políticas que aumentaron la intervención del gobierno en la economía.[44]​ De 1920 a 1933 se estableció una ley seca conocida como La prohibición.[45]​ La Dust Bowl (cuenca de polvo) de mediados de la década de 1930 dejó varias comunidades de agricultores empobrecidos y estimuló una nueva ola de migración hacia la costa occidental.[46]​\n\nEstados Unidos, oficialmente neutral durante las primeras etapas de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, inició el suministro de provisiones a los Aliados en marzo de 1941, a través del Programa de Préstamo y Arriendo. El 7 de diciembre de 1941, el país se unió a la lucha de los Aliados contra las Potencias del Eje, después del ataque japonés a Pearl Harbor. La Segunda Guerra Mundial impulsó la economía mediante el suministro de capital de inversión y puestos de trabajo, haciendo que muchas mujeres entraran en el mercado laboral. De los principales combatientes, Estados Unidos fue la única nación que se enriqueció a causa de la guerra. ​ Las conferencias en Bretton Woods y Yalta crearon un nuevo sistema de organización internacional que colocó al país y a la Unión Soviética en el centro de los asuntos mundiales. En 1945, cuando llegó el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial en Europa, una conferencia internacional celebrada en San Francisco redactó la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, que entró en vigor después de la guerra.[48]​ Después de haber desarrollado la primera arma nuclear, el gobierno decidió utilizarla en las ciudades japonesas de Hiroshima y Nagasaki en agosto de ese mismo año. Japón se rindió el 2 de septiembre, poniendo fin a la guerra.[49]​\n\nEn la Guerra Fría, Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética compitieron tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, dominando los asuntos militares de Europa a través de la OTAN y del Pacto de Varsovia. El primero promovió la democracia liberal y el capitalismo, mientras que el segundo extendía el comunismo y una economía planificada por el gobierno. Ambos apoyaron varias dictaduras y participaron en guerras subsidiarias. Entre 1950 y 1953, las tropas estadounidenses combatieron a las fuerzas comunistas chinas en la guerra de Corea.[50]​ Desde la ruptura con la URSS y el inicio de la Guerra Fría y hasta 1957, dentro de Estados Unidos se desarrolló el macarthismo, también llamado Segundo Temor rojo, en el que el Estado desató una ola de represión política y una campaña de miedo contra aquellas personas comunistas o simplemente sospechosas de serlo, que algunos autores señalan como propio de un Estado totalitario. Cientos de personas fueron detenidas, incluidas decenas de celebridades, y entre diez mil y doce mil personas perdieron sus puestos de trabajo.[51]​ La persecución finalizó cuando los tribunales la declararon inconstitucional.[52]​\n\nEn 1961, el lanzamiento soviético de la primera nave espacial tripulada provocó que el presidente John F. Kennedy propusiera al país ser los primeros en enviar «un hombre a la Luna», hecho logrado en 1969.[53]​ Kennedy también enfrentó un tenso conflicto nuclear con las fuerzas soviéticas en Cuba, al tiempo que la economía crecía y se expandía de manera constante. Un creciente movimiento por los derechos civiles, representado y liderado por afroamericanos como Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King y James Bevel, utilizó la no violencia para hacer frente a la segregación y la discriminación.[54]​ Después del asesinato de Kennedy en 1963, la Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964 y la Ley de Derechos Electorales de 1965 se aprobaron durante el mandato del presidente Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson y su sucesor, Richard Nixon, llevaron una guerra civil subsidiaria en el sudeste asiático a la infructuosa guerra de Vietnam.[50]​ Un movimiento contracultural generalizado creció, impulsado por la oposición a la guerra, el nacionalismo negro y la revolución sexual. También surgió una nueva ola de movimientos feministas, liderados por Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem y otras mujeres que buscaban la equidad política, social y económica.\n\nEn 1974, como resultado del escándalo Watergate, Nixon se convirtió en el primer presidente en renunciar, para evitar ser destituido por cargos como obstrucción a la justicia y abuso de poder; fue sucedido por el vicepresidente Gerald Ford.[55]​ La administración de Jimmy Carter en la segunda mitad de la década de 1970 (1977-1981) estuvo marcada por la estanflación y la crisis de los rehenes en Irán. La elección de Ronald Reagan como presidente en 1980 anunció un cambio en la política estadounidense, que se reflejó en reformas importantes en los impuestos y gastos fiscales. Su segundo mandato trajo consigo el escándalo Irán-Contra y el significativo progreso diplomático con la Unión Soviética. El posterior colapso soviético terminó la Guerra Fría.\n\nBajo el mandato del presidente George H. W. Bush, el país tomó un papel de liderazgo hegemónico mundial, como en la guerra del Golfo (1991). La expansión económica más larga en la historia moderna de Estados Unidos, desde marzo de 1991 hasta marzo de 2001, abarcó la administración de Bill Clinton y la burbuja punto com.[56]​ Una demanda civil y un escándalo sexual llevó al impeachment de Clinton en 1998, aunque logró terminar su periodo. Las elecciones presidenciales de 2000, de las más competidas en la historia estadounidense, fueron resueltas por una decisión de la Corte Suprema. George W. Bush, hijo de George H. W. Bush, fue proclamado presidente a pesar de que obtuvo menos votos que su rival, Al Gore.[57]​ Esta situación, que ha ocurrido tres veces en la historia, se debe al sistema de voto estadounidense (colegiado).\n\nEl 11 de septiembre de 2001, los terroristas del grupo Al-Qaeda atacaron las Torres Gemelas del World Trade Center de la ciudad de Nueva York (que fueron destruidas) y El Pentágono cerca de Washington D. C., en una serie de atentados que acabó con la vida de casi tres mil personas. En respuesta, la administración de Bush lanzó la «guerra contra el terrorismo». A finales de 2001, las fuerzas estadounidenses invadieron Afganistán, derrocaron al gobierno talibán y destruyeron los campos de entrenamiento de Al-Qaeda. Los insurgentes talibanes continúan luchando una guerra de guerrillas. En 2002 Bush comenzó a presionar para que se llevara a cabo un cambio de régimen en Irak.[58]​[59]​ Con la falta de apoyo de la OTAN y sin un mandato explícito de la ONU para una intervención militar, Bush organizó la coalición de la voluntad; las fuerzas de la coalición rápidamente invadieron Irak en 2003 y derrocaron al dictador Saddam Hussein. Al año siguiente, Bush fue reelegido como el presidente más votado en unas elecciones.\n\nEn 2005, el huracán Katrina, que terminaría siendo el desastre natural más mortífero en la historia nacional, causó una destrucción severa a lo largo de la costa del Golfo: la ciudad de Nueva Orleans quedó devastada,[60]​ con 1833 muertos.\n\nEl 4 de noviembre de 2008, en medio de una recesión económica mundial, Barack Obama fue elegido presidente, habiendo sido el primer afroamericano en ocupar el cargo. En mayo de 2011, las fuerzas especiales estadounidenses lograron matar a Osama bin Laden, escondido en Pakistán. Al año siguiente, Barack Obama fue reelegido. Bajo su segundo mandato impartió la guerra contra el Estado Islámico y se restablecieron las relaciones diplomáticas con Cuba.\n\nEl 8 de noviembre de 2016, el magnate Donald Trump por el Partido Republicano venció a la ex primera dama Hillary Clinton para la presidencia en unas elecciones insólitas[61]​ y cuyos planes han sido descritos por analistas políticos como populistas, proteccionistas y nacionalistas, jurando el cargo el 20 de enero de 2017.\n\nLas masacres en Orlando del 12 de junio de 2016 en la discoteca gay Pulse (51 muertos)[62]​ y en Las Vegas el 1 de octubre de 2017 (60) figuran como las mayores matanzas del país desde los atentados del 11-S.\n\nEl 7 de noviembre de 2020, Joe Biden gana las elecciones presidenciales, venciendo a Donald Trump quien no consiguió la reelección presidencial. Es la segunda vez que un presidente estadounidense no alcanza la reelección después de George H. W. Bush. Biden juró al cargo el 20 de enero de 2021. El 6 de enero de 2021, los partidarios del presidente saliente Trump irrumpieron en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos en un esfuerzo infructuoso por interrumpir el recuento de votos del Colegio Electoral presidencial.[63]​\n\nEstados Unidos es la federación más antigua del mundo. Es una república constitucional, democrática y representativa, «en la que el mandato de la mayoría es regulado por los derechos de las minorías, protegidos por la ley». ​ El gobierno está regulado por un sistema de controles y equilibrios, definidos por la Constitución, que sirve como el documento legal supremo del país.[65]​ En el sistema federalista estadounidense, los ciudadanos están generalmente sujetos a tres niveles de gobierno: federal, estatal y local; los deberes del gobierno local comúnmente se dividen entre los gobiernos de los condados y municipios. En casi todos los casos, los funcionarios del poder ejecutivo y legislativo son elegidos por sufragio directo de los ciudadanos del distrito.\n\nEl gobierno federal se divide en tres ramas de poder:[65]​\n• Poder legislativo: El Congreso bicameral, compuesto por el Senado y la Cámara de Representantes. Su función es crear las leyes federales, hacer declaraciones de guerra, aprobar los tratados, administran los fondos públicos y tiene el poder del impeachment, por medio del cual pueden destituir a funcionarios del gobierno.\n• Poder ejecutivo: El presidente es el comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas, puede vetar los proyectos de ley antes de que se conviertan en leyes oficiales y nombra a los miembros del gabinete (sujeto a la aprobación del Senado) y otros oficiales, que administran y hacer cumplir las leyes federales y políticas.\n• Poder judicial: La Corte Suprema y los tribunales federales inferiores, cuyos jueces son nombrados por el presidente con la aprobación del Senado, interpretan las leyes y suprimen las que se consideren anticonstitucionales.\n\nLa Cámara de Representantes tiene 435 miembros electos, cada uno representando a un distrito del Congreso para un mandato de dos años.[65]​ Los lugares dentro de la cámara se distribuyen entre los estados según su población cada diez años. Según el censo de 2000, siete estados tienen el mínimo de un representante, mientras que California, el estado más poblado, tiene cincuenta y tres. El Senado tiene cien miembros, ya que cada estado cuenta con dos senadores, elegidos para un término de seis años; un tercio de los escaños en el Senado son electos cada dos años.[65]​ La Corte Suprema, liderada por el jefe de justicia, tiene nueve miembros, que sirven de manera permanente.[65]​\n\nEl presidente cumple mandato por un término de cuatro años y podrá ser reelegido para el cargo no más de una vez. El presidente no es elegido por sufragio directo, sino por un sistema indirecto de colegios electorales, en el que los votos determinantes son prorrateados por estado.[65]​ Un estado solo puede brindar determinada cantidad de votos según el número de congresistas que tenga dentro del poder legislativo: senadores (dos por cada estado) y representantes (que varía según la población de cada estado); dando un total de 538 miembros. El sistema bipartidista del país permite que un candidato a la presidencia, ya sea republicano o demócrata, solo necesite 270 votos para asegurar la victoria.[66]​\n\nLos gobiernos de los cincuenta estados están estructurados de manera más o menos similar, aunque Nebraska es el único que tiene una legislatura unicameral.[67]​ El gobernador (jefe ejecutivo) de cada estado es elegido por sufragio directo. Algunos jueces de estado y funcionarios de gabinete son designados por los gobernadores de los respectivos estados, mientras que otros son elegidos por voto popular.\n\nTodas las leyes y los procedimientos gubernamentales están sujetas a revisión judicial, y se anula cualquier ley que esté en contra de la Constitución. El texto original de la Constitución establece la estructura y responsabilidades del gobierno federal y su relación con los gobiernos estados.[65]​ El Artículo I protege el derecho al «gran recurso» de habeas corpus[30]​ y el Artículo III garantiza el derecho a un juicio con jurado en todos los casos penales.[30]​ Las enmiendas a la Constitución requieren la aprobación de tres cuartas partes de los estados. La Constitución ha sido enmendada veintisiete veces; las primeras diez enmiendas, que componen la Carta de Derechos y la decimocuarta enmienda forman la base central de las garantías individuales.[30]​\n\nEstados Unidos ejerce una influencia económica, política y militar a nivel mundial. Es un miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas, además de que la Sede de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas se encuentra en la ciudad de Nueva York. También es miembro del G8, el G-20 y la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico. La inmensa mayoría de los países tienen una embajada o un consulado en Washington D. C. u otra ciudad importante del país. A su vez, casi todos los países del mundo cuentan con una misión diplomática estadounidense.[68]​ Sin embargo, Corea del Norte, Bután, Sudán y la República de China (Taiwán) no tienen relaciones diplomáticas formales con la nación.\n\nTambién goza de fuertes lazos con el Reino Unido, Canadá, Australia, Nueva Zelanda, Japón, Corea del Sur e Israel. Trabaja en estrecha colaboración con sus colegas de la Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte sobre cuestiones militares y de seguridad, y con sus vecinos a través de la Organización de los Estados Americanos y de tratados internacionales como el acuerdo trilateral del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte con Canadá y México. En 2012, Estados Unidos gastó un neto de 30 460 millones de dólares en ayuda oficial al desarrollo, la mayor cantidad en el mundo, aunque en términos de porcentaje del producto interior bruto (PIB), su contribución de 0.19 % ocupó uno de los últimos lugares entre las veintitrés naciones donantes. En contraste, las empresas privadas estadounidenses son relativamente más generosas.[69]​[70]​\n\nEl presidente ostenta el título de comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas de la nación y nombra a sus líderes: el Secretario de Defensa y la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor. El Departamento de Defensa administra las fuerzas armadas, incluyendo el Ejército, la Armada, el Cuerpo de Marines y la Fuerza Aérea. La Guardia Costera es administrada por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional en tiempos de paz y por el Departamento de la Armada en tiempo de guerra. En 2008, las fuerzas armadas contaban con 1.4 millones de miembros activos. Las reservas y la Guardia Nacional elevan el número total de tropas a 2.3 millones. El Departamento de Defensa también emplea a aproximadamente setencientos mil civiles, sin incluir a los contratistas.[71]​\n\nEl servicio militar es voluntario, aunque en tiempos de guerra el Estado puede imponer el reclutamiento a través de un sistema de servicio selectivo, el llamado «Selective Service System».[72]​ Como la gran potencia militar del mundo, las fuerzas armadas de Estados Unidos poseen las más avanzadas máquinas de guerra. Cuenta con miles de aviones, cientos de embarcaciones, carros de combate, misiles intercontinentales (ICBM), miles de ojivas nucleares y tiene diez portaaviones activos en la Armada; además, posee fuerzas aeronavales de carácter permanente en las costas del océano Atlántico ―Fleet Forces Command―, Pacífico ―Flota del Pacífico― y el Golfo Pérsico ―Quinta Flota―.\n\nLa instalación progresiva de las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses a gran escala empezó con la división y ocupación de Alemania en 1945, se amplió con la guerra fría en sus países de influencia, y continúa vigente.\n\nEl ejército opera alrededor de 870 bases e instalaciones en el extranjero[73]​ y mantiene guarniciones de más de 100 militares activos en 28 países distintos.[74]​ El alcance de esta presencia militar global ha llevado a algunos autores a describir al país como si mantuviera un «imperio de bases».[75]​[76]​\n\nLos gastos militares en 2020, fueron de 740 500 millones de dólares,[77]​ aproximadamente el 37.5 % del gasto militar mundial[78]​ y más altos que los gastos juntos de los siguientes catorce países con los ejércitos más grandes. El gasto per cápita fue de 1967 dólares, alrededor de nueve veces el promedio mundial; ocupando el 4.4 % del PIB[79]​ y el 18 % del presupuesto federal.[80]​ El presupuesto base del Departamento de Defensa para 2010 ―fijado en 533 800 millones de dólares― aumentó un 4 % en 2009 y un 80 % más que en 2001; se destinarán 130 000 millones de dólares adicionales para las campañas militares en Irak y Afganistán.[81]​ En mayo de 2010 había 94 000 soldados estadounidenses desplegados en Afganistán y 92 000 en Irak.[82]​ Para junio de 2010, el ejército estadounidense había sufrido 4400 bajas durante la guerra en Irak[83]​ y 1087 durante la guerra en Afganistán.[84]​\n\nEstados Unidos cuenta, según las informaciones disponibles, con los mayores servicios de inteligencia del mundo, que se agrupan y coordinan alrededor de la llamada Comunidad de Inteligencia ―United States Intelligence Community (IC)―. Diecisiete agencias federales de inteligencia forman esta comunidad; estas agencias generalmente están subordinadas al Departamento de Defensa o al Departamento de Justicia, mientras que otras tienen la consideración de agencia independiente federal, por lo que solo deben rendir cuentas al Director Nacional de Inteligencia y al Presidente de los Estados Unidos. Las agencias de la comunidad ―tanto militares como civiles― se dedican a actividades de inteligencia relacionadas con asuntos exteriores y la seguridad nacional y cuentan con cientos de miles de empleados ―107 035 a mediados de 2013, último dato conocido―[85]​ y unos presupuestos confidenciales que solo en 2013 sumaron 52 600 millones de dólares.[85]​ Una de las agencias que la componen es la célebre Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA).[86]​\n\nEn 2010, según informaciones de The Washington Post, 1271 organizaciones gubernamentales, 1931 empresas privadas y 854 000 personas con acceso a espacios e información de alto secreto se dedicaban en Estados Unidos a labores de contraterrorismo, inteligencia y seguridad nacional.[87]​\n\nEn materia de derechos humanos, respecto a la pertenencia a los siete organismos de la Carta Internacional de Derechos Humanos, que incluyen al Comité de Derechos Humanos (HRC), Estados Unidos de América ha firmado o ratificado:\n\nEstados Unidos es una unión federal de cincuenta estados. Los trece estados originales fueron los sucesores de las Trece Colonias que se rebelaron contra el Imperio británico. Poco después de la independencia, se crearon tres nuevos estados a partir de otros ya existentes: Kentucky de Virginia; Tennessee de Carolina del Norte y Maine de Massachusetts. La mayoría de los otros estados fueron creados a partir de territorios obtenidos a través de la guerra o la compra por parte del gobierno. Vermont, Texas y Hawái son la excepción: cada uno de ellos fue una república independiente antes de integrarse a la Unión. Durante la guerra de Secesión, Virginia Occidental se separó de Virginia. El estado más reciente es Hawái, que logró el reconocimiento como estado el 21 de agosto de 1959. Los estados no tienen el derecho de separarse de la Unión.\n\nLos estados componen gran parte del territorio estadounidense; las otras dos áreas que se consideran parte integrante del país son el Distrito de Columbia ―el distrito federal donde se encuentra la capital Washington D. C.― y el Atolón Palmyra, un territorio deshabitado pero incorporado, ubicado en el océano Pacífico. Estados Unidos también posee cinco grandes territorios de ultramar: Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes de los Estados Unidos en el Caribe y Samoa Americana, Guam y las Islas Marianas del Norte en el Pacífico. Aquellos que nacieron en esos territorios (excepto en la Samoa Americana) poseen la ciudadanía estadounidense. Los ciudadanos estadounidenses que residen en los territorios tienen muchos de los derechos y responsabilidades de los ciudadanos que residen en los estados; sin embargo, generalmente están exentos del pago de impuestos federales, no pueden votar en las elecciones presidenciales y solo tienen representación en calidad de observadores en el Congreso. ​\n\nLa superficie de los Estados Unidos continentales es de aproximadamente 7 700 000 km² (kilómetros cuadrados). Alaska, que está separada de los Estados Unidos continentales por Canadá, es el estado más grande del país, con 1 500 000 km². Hawái, ocupa un archipiélago ubicado en el Pacífico central, al suroeste de América del Norte, que abarca poco más de 16 000 km².[99]​ Después de Rusia y Canadá, es el tercer o cuarto país más grande del mundo por área total (tierra y agua), clasificado justo por encima o por debajo de China. La lista varía dependiendo de si se consideran los territorios en disputa entre China y la India y de cómo se calcula el tamaño total de los Estados Unidos: The World Factbook de la CIA considera 9 833 517 km²,[5]​ la División de Estadísticas de las Naciones Unidas calcula 9 629 091 km²,[100]​ y la Enciclopedia Británica estipula 9 522 055 km².[101]​ Incluyendo solo la superficie de la tierra, Estados Unidos es tercero en tamaño detrás de Rusia y Canadá, justo por delante de China.[102]​\n\nEl territorio nacional cuenta con múltiples formas de relieve y accidentes geográficos. A medida que se avanza tierra adentro, la llanura costera del litoral Atlántico da lugar al bosque caducifolio y a la meseta de Piedmont. Los Apalaches separan la costa oriental de los Grandes Lagos de las praderas del Medio Oeste. El río Misisipi-Misuri, el cuarto sistema fluvial más largo del mundo, corre de norte a sur a través del centro del país. La pradera llana y fértil de las Grandes Llanuras se extiende hacia el oeste, hasta que es interrumpida por una región de tierras altas en el sureste. Las Montañas Rocosas, en el borde occidental de las Grandes Llanuras, atraviesan de norte a sur todo el país, llegando a altitudes superiores a los 4300 m s. n. m. (metros sobre el nivel del mar) en Colorado. Más hacia el oeste se encuentra la Gran Cuenca y los desiertos, tales como el desierto de Mojave, de Sonora y de Chihuahua. Las montañas de la Sierra Nevada y la cordillera de las Cascadas se encuentran cerca de la costa del Pacífico. Con sus 6194 m s. n. m., el monte McKinley en Alaska es el punto más alto del país. Los volcanes activos son comunes a lo largo de Alaska y las islas Aleutianas, además de que Hawái consta de solo islas volcánicas. El supervolcán ubicado debajo del parque nacional Yellowstone en las montañas Rocosas, es la forma volcánica más grande del continente.[103]​\n\nPor su gran tamaño y variedad geográfica, el país cuenta con la mayoría de los tipos de clima. Al este del meridiano 100, el clima varía de continental húmedo en el norte a húmedo subtropical en el sur. El extremo sur de la Florida y las islas de Hawái tienen un clima tropical. Las Grandes Llanuras al oeste del meridiano 100 son semiáridas, mientras que gran parte de las montañas occidentales poseen un clima alpino. El clima es árido en la Gran Cuenca y en los desiertos del suroeste, es mediterráneo en la costa de California y oceánico en la costa sur de Alaska, Oregón y Washington. La mayor parte del territorio alaskeño tiene un clima subártico o polar. Los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos no son raros; los estados ribereños del golfo de México son propensos a huracanes y la mayoría de los tornados del mundo se desarrollan dentro del país, principalmente en la zona de Tornado Alley, en el Medio Oeste.[104]​\n\nEstados Unidos es considerado un país megadiverso: unas 17 000 especies de plantas vasculares viven en los Estados Unidos contiguos y Alaska y más de 1800 especies de plantas con flores se pueden encontrar tan solo en Hawái, pocas de las cuales crecen en el continente.[105]​ El país es el hábitat de más de 400 especies de mamíferos, 750 especies de aves y 500 especies de reptiles y anfibios.[106]​ Aquí también se han descubierto más de 91 000 diferentes clases de insectos.[107]​\n\nLa Ley de Especies en Peligro aprobada en 1973 protege a las especies amenazadas y en peligro de extinción y sus hábitats, que son supervisados por el Servicio de Pesca y Vida Silvestre de los Estados Unidos. En total, el gobierno federal posee el 28.8 % de la superficie total del país.[108]​ La mayor parte de este porcentaje está conformado por los cincuenta y ocho parques nacionales y cientos de otras áreas naturales protegidas administradas por las autoridades federales y estatales.[109]​ Del resto de las tierras del gobierno, algunas son alquiladas para la extracción de petróleo y gas natural, para la minería, agricultura o ganadería; solo el 2.4 % se utiliza para fines militares.[108]​\n\nLa economía de los Estados Unidos es una economía mixta capitalista, que se caracteriza por los abundantes recursos naturales, una infraestructura desarrollada y una alta productividad. ​ De acuerdo al Fondo Monetario Internacional, su PIB de 15.7 billones USD constituye el 24 % del Producto Mundial Bruto y cerca del 21 % del mismo en términos de paridad de poder adquisitivo (PPA).[9]​ Este es el PIB más grande en el mundo, aunque en 2008 era un 5 % menor que el PIB (PPA) de la Unión Europea. El país tiene el undécimo PIB per cápita nominal y el sexto PIB (PPA) per cápita más altos del mundo.[9]​ Además, el país está en segundo lugar del Índice de Competitividad Global de 2010.[111]​\n\nEstados Unidos es el importador de bienes más grande a nivel internacional y el tercero en términos de exportaciones, aunque las exportaciones per cápita son relativamente bajas para ser un país desarrollado. En 2008, el total de la balanza comercial estadounidense era de 696 000 millones de dólares.[112]​ En 2009, los automóviles constituyeron los principales productos exportados e importados.[113]​ Canadá, China, México, Alemania y Japón son sus principales socios comerciales.[114]​ Ese último es el que tiene la mayor deuda pública con Estados Unidos, ya que a principios de 2010 superó la deuda de China con 34 200 millones de dólares.[115]​\n\nEn 2010, el sector privado constituía un estimado del 55.3 % de la economía de Estados Unidos, las actividades del gobierno federal sumaban el 24.1 % y la actividad de los gobiernos estatales y locales ocupaban el restante 20.6 %.[118]​ Pese a que la economía estadounidense es posindustrial, ya que el sector servicios contribuye con el 67.8 % del PIB, la nación continúa siendo una potencia industrial.[119]​ En el campo de negocios, la actividad líder por sus ingresos es el comercio al por mayor y al por menor; por ingresos netos es la industria,[120]​ siendo la industria química la más importante.[121]​ Estados Unidos es el tercer productor de petróleo más importante en el mundo, así como el mayor importador de este producto.[122]​[123]​[124]​ También es el productor número uno de energía eléctrica y de energía nuclear, así como gas natural licuado, azufre, fosfatos y sal. Mientras que la agricultura representa menos del 1 % del PIB,[119]​ el país es el mayor productor de maíz[125]​ y soya.[126]​ Toda esta producción contribuye a que la bolsa de Nueva York sea la más grande del mundo.[127]​ A su vez, las empresas estadounidenses de Coca-Cola, McDonalds y Microsoft son las marcas más reconocidas en el mundo.[128]​\n\nEn el tercer trimestre de 2009, la fuerza de trabajo estadounidense era de 154.4 millones de personas. De estos empleados, un 81 % poseía un empleo en el sector de los servicios. Con 22.4 millones de personas, el gobierno es el principal campo de empleo.[129]​ Aproximadamente el 12 % de los trabajadores están sindicalizados, en comparación con el 30 % de Europa occidental.[130]​ El Banco Mundial clasifica a los Estados Unidos en primer lugar en la facilidad de contratación y liquidación de los trabajadores.[131]​ Entre 1973 y 2003, el año laboral para un estadounidense promedio creció 199 horas.[132]​ En parte como consecuencia, el país sostiene la máxima productividad de mano de obra en el mundo. En 2008, también llegó al primer puesto en productividad por hora, superando a Noruega, Francia, Bélgica y Luxemburgo, que habían superado a los Estados Unidos la mayor parte de la década anterior.[133]​ Comparado con Europa, los impuestos corporativos y de propiedad son más altos, mientras que los impuestos al consumidor son más bajos.[134]​\n\nAl ser un país desarrollado, Estados Unidos cuenta con una infraestructura de transportes avanzada: 6 465 799 km (kilómetros) de carreteras, 226 427 km de vías férreas, 15 095 aeropuertos y 41 009 km de vías fluviales.[136]​ La mayor parte de sus habitantes utilizan el automóvil como su principal medio de transporte. En 2003, había 759 automóviles por cada 1000 personas, en comparación con los 472 por cada 1000 habitantes de la Unión Europea.[137]​ Más del 40 % de los vehículos personales son camionetas, todoterrenos o camiones ligeros.[138]​ El adulto estadounidense promedio (incluyendo a conductores y no conductores) pasa diariamente 55 minutos en un automóvil, viajando una distancia de 47 km.[139]​\n\nLa industria aérea civil es propiedad privada, mientras que la mayoría de aeropuertos son de propiedad pública. Las tres aerolíneas más grandes en el mundo son de capital estadounidense: Southwest Airlines, American Airlines y Delta Air Lines.[140]​ De los treinta aeropuertos con mayor tránsito de pasajeros en el mundo, dieciséis están en el país, siendo el más concurrido de todos el Aeropuerto Internacional Hartsfield-Jackson en Atlanta.[141]​ Mientras que el transporte de mercancías por ferrocarril es muy importante, relativamente pocas personas utilizan este medio de transporte para viajar, dentro o entre las zonas urbanas.[142]​ Solamente el 9 % de las personas utilizan el transporte público para acudir al trabajo, un nivel muy bajo comparado con el 38.8 % de Europa.[143]​ También el uso de la bicicleta es mínimo, muy por debajo de los niveles europeos.[144]​\n\nEl consumo energético total del país es de 3873 billones kWh anuales, lo que equivale a un consumo per cápita de 7.8 toneladas de petróleo al año.[136]​ En 2005, un 40 % de esta energía provenía del petróleo, 23 % del carbón y 22 % del gas natural; el resto provenía de centrales nucleares y fuentes de energía renovable.[145]​ Estados Unidos es el mayor consumidor de petróleo y de gas natural: anualmente utiliza 19.5 millones de barriles de petróleo y 627 200 millones de metros cúbicos de gas natural.[123]​[146]​ Por otro lado, en el país se encuentran el 27 % de las reservas mundiales de carbón.[147]​ Por décadas, la energía nuclear ha jugado un papel limitado en la producción de energía, en comparación con la mayoría de los países desarrollados, debido en parte a la reacción pública después del accidente de Three Mile Island. Sin embargo, en 2007 el gobierno recibió múltiples peticiones para la construcción de nuevas centrales nucleares, lo que podría significar una disminución considerable en el consumo de combustibles fósiles[148]​ y un cambio en la política energética.\n\nEn el último censo decenal del país (2020), la cifra asciende a 331 449 281 de habitantes en abril de 2020 según la Oficina Nacional del Censo.[149]​ Esta cifra incluye un estimado de 11.2 millones de inmigrantes ilegales,[150]​ pero excluye la población de cinco territorios no incorporados (Puerto Rico, Islas Vírgenes de los Estados Unidos, Guam, Samoa americana e Islas Marianas del Norte). Esto la convierte en la tercera nación más poblada en el mundo, después de China y la India. Además, Estados Unidos es la única nación industrializada donde se prevé un aumento significativo en la población.[151]​ Con una tasa de natalidad de 13.82 bebés por cada 1000 habitantes (30 % por debajo de la media mundial), su tasa de crecimiento demográfico es de 0.98 %, significativamente más alto que los de Europa occidental, Japón y Corea del Sur.[152]​ En el año fiscal de 2009, 1.1 millones de inmigrantes obtuvieron la residencia legal.[153]​ México ha sido el principal país de origen de los nuevos residentes durante más de dos décadas; desde 1998, China, India y Filipinas también se han destacado en este sentido cada año.[154]​\n\nEstados Unidos tiene una población muy diversa: treinta y un diferentes grupos étnicos cuentan con más de un millón de representantes.[155]​ Los blancos estadounidenses son el grupo étnico más grande; los germano-estadounidenses, los hiberno-estadounidenses y los angloamericanos constituyen tres de los cuatro grupos étnicos más numerosos del país.[155]​ Los afroamericanos son la «minoría» racial más importante y el tercer grupo étnico más grande.[155]​[156]​ Los asiáticos son la segunda «minoría» racial con mayor presencia; dentro de este grupo destacan los grupos de origen chino y filipino.[155]​ En 2008, la población incluía un estimado de 6 millones de personas con ascendencia indígena, ya sea de un pueblo amerindio (1.8 millones), alaskeño (3.1 millones), hawaiano (500 000) o de una isla del Pacífico (600 000).[156]​\n\nEl crecimiento de la población de origen latinoamericano es una importante tendencia demográfica. De acuerdo a la Oficina Nacional del Censo, los 46.9 millones de descendientes de latinos o hispanos[156]​ son un grupo heterogéneo que comparten una distinta «etnicidad», así 64 % de los hispanos son de ascendencia mexicana.[157]​ Entre 2000 y 2008, la población hispana aumentó 32 %, mientras que la población no hispana aumentó solo un 4.3 %.[156]​ Gran parte de este crecimiento es debido a la inmigración, por ejemplo, en 2007 el 12.6 % de la población estadounidense había nacido en el extranjero, de los cuales, el 54 % nacieron en América Latina.[158]​ La tasa de fecundidad también es un factor: la mujer hispana promedio da a luz a tres niños, mientras que las mujeres negras tienen 2.2 y las mujeres blancas 1.8.[151]​ Las minorías (definidas por la Oficina del Censo como todos aquellos que no son hispanos o blancos) constituyen el 34 % de la población y se prevé que constituirán la mayoría para el 2042.[159]​\n\nAlrededor del 82 % de los estadounidenses viven en zonas urbanas (tal como las define la Oficina del Censo, estas áreas incluyen los suburbios);[136]​ cerca de la mitad residen en ciudades con una población superior a cincuenta mil habitantes.[160]​ En 2008, 273 localidades contaban con más de cien mil personas, nueve ciudades tenían más de un millón de residentes y cuatro ciudades globales tenían más de dos millones de residentes (Nueva York, Los Ángeles, Chicago y Houston).[161]​ Existen cincuenta y dos áreas metropolitanas con más de un millón de habitantes.[162]​ De las cincuenta áreas metropolitanas de más rápido crecimiento demográfico, cuarenta y siete se encuentran en el oeste y en el sur.[163]​ Las áreas metropolitanas de Dallas, Houston, Atlanta y Phoenix aumentaron su población en más de un millón de personas entre 2000 y 2008.[162]​\n\nLa educación pública estadounidense es operada por los gobiernos estatales y locales, regulados por el Departamento de Educación de los Estados Unidos. Es obligatorio que los niños asistan a la escuela desde los seis o siete años (por lo general, al jardín de niños o al primer grado de educación primaria) hasta que cumplen los dieciocho años (generalmente hasta cursar el duodécimo grado, el final de la escuela secundaria); algunos estados permiten a los estudiantes abandonar la escuela a los dieciséis o diecisiete años.[164]​ Aproximadamente el 12 % de los niños están inscritos en escuelas privadas, mientras que el 2 % recibe educación en el hogar.[165]​ Existen múltiples instituciones privadas y públicas de educación superior, así como de colleges comunitarios con las políticas de admisión abierta. De las personas mayores de veinticinco años, el 84.6 % se graduó de la escuela secundaria, un 52.6 % asistió a algún college, el 27.2 % obtuvo una licenciatura y el 9.6 % obtuvo un título de posgrado.[166]​ La tasa de alfabetización es de aproximadamente un 99 %.[136]​ La ONU le asigna al país un índice de educación de 0.97, el 12.º más alto en el mundo.[167]​ De acuerdo a la Unesco, Estados Unidos es el segundo país con más instituciones de educación superior en el mundo, con un total de 5758 y un promedio de más de 15 por cada estado.[168]​ El país también cuenta con el mayor número de estudiantes universitarios en el mundo, ascendiendo a 14 261 778, es decir, casi el 4.75 % de la población total.[169]​ Finalmente, aquí se encuentran algunas de las universidades más prestigiosas y de mayor fama en todo el mundo. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford y el Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts son consideradas como las mejores universidades por varias publicaciones.[170]​[171]​[172]​\n\nEl inglés es el idioma nacional de facto. Aunque no existe ningún idioma oficial a nivel federal, algunas leyes ―como los Requisitos para la Naturalización― colocan al inglés como idioma obligatorio. En 2006, cerca de 241 millones, o sea, el 78 % de la población mayor de cinco años, hablaba únicamente el inglés en casa. El español, hablado por el 13 % de la población, es el segundo idioma más hablado, y el que más comúnmente se aprende como segunda lengua.[173]​[174]​ Algunas personas abogan por convertir el inglés en el idioma oficial, como lo es en al menos 28 estados.[175]​ El hawaiano y el inglés son los idiomas oficiales de Hawái,[176]​ mientras que el siux y el inglés son los de Dakota del Sur.[177]​\n\nAunque carecen de un idioma oficial, Nuevo México tiene leyes que alientan el uso del inglés y el español, de la misma forma que Luisiana lo hace con el inglés y el francés cajún. ​ En otros estados, como en California, la publicación de ciertos documentos oficiales en español es obligatoria.[179]​[180]​ Los territorios insulares garantizan el reconocimiento oficial de los idiomas nativos, junto con el inglés: el samoano y el chamorro son reconocidos por Samoa Americana y Guam, respectivamente; el carolinio y el chamorro son reconocidos por las Islas Marianas del Norte, y el español es un idioma oficial de Puerto Rico.\n\nAdemás de las lenguas mencionadas, se siguen hablando un número elevado de lenguas nativas en numerosas reservas por todo el país y pequeñas localidades. Cada una de estas lenguas cuenta con unos pocos de miles de hablantes, y la más importante demográficamente es el navajo, con casi doscientos mil hablantes nativos.\n\nEstados Unidos es oficialmente un Estado laico; la Primera Enmienda garantiza el libre ejercicio de la religión y prohíbe el establecimiento de cualquier gobierno religioso.[30]​ En un estudio de 2002, el 59 % de los estadounidenses aseguró que la religión desempeñaba un «papel muy importante en sus vidas», una cifra más elevada que la de cualquier otra nación desarrollada.[181]​ De acuerdo con una encuesta de 2007, un 78.4 % de los adultos se identificaron como cristianos,[182]​ registrándose una disminución desde 1990, cuando eran el 86.4 %.[183]​ Las denominaciones protestantes representaban el 51.3 %, mientras que la Iglesia católica con el 23.9 %, era la corriente religiosa más grande. El estudio clasifica a los evangélicos blancos, 26.3 % de la población, como la cohorte religiosa más grande del país;[182]​ otro estudio estima que los evangélicos de todas las razas conforman entre el 30 y 35 % de la población.[184]​ En 1990, el total de adeptos a religiones no cristianas eran el 3.3 %, para 2007 había crecido hasta un 4.7 %.[183]​ Las principales religiones no cristianas eran el judaísmo (1.7 %), el budismo (0.7 %), el islam (0.6 %), el hinduismo (0.4 %) y el unitarismo universalista (0.3 %).[182]​ La encuesta también informó que el 16.1 % de los estadounidenses se describían a sí mismos como agnósticos, ateos o simplemente sin ninguna religión.[182]​[183]​\n\nEn 2006, la esperanza de vida era de 77.8 años,[185]​ siendo un año más corta que el promedio de Europa occidental, y mucho más corta que la de países como Noruega, Suiza y Canadá.[186]​ Durante las últimas dos décadas, el nivel de esperanza de vida cayó del 11.º lugar mundial, hasta el 42.º.[187]​ La mortalidad infantil es de 6.37 fallecimientos por cada 1000 nacidos vivos.[188]​ Aproximadamente un tercio de la población adulta es obesa y otro tercio tiene sobrepeso;[189]​ el índice de obesidad, uno de los más altos del mundo, se ha duplicado en los últimos veinticinco años. ​ La alta incidencia de diabetes tipo 2 relacionada con la obesidad se considera una epidemia por algunos profesionales de la salud.[191]​ El índice de embarazos en la adolescencia asciende a 79.8 por cada 1000 mujeres, cuatro veces el índice de Francia y cinco veces el de Alemania.[192]​ El aborto, legal en algunos casos, es un tema muy controvertido: muchos estados prohibieron la financiación pública del procedimiento, restringieron el aborto cuando el feto ya está desarrollado, requieren notificación parental para las menores y un período de espera. La tasa de aborto está disminuyendo, ya que existen 241 por cada 1000 nacimientos, aunque sigue siendo superior al de la mayoría de las naciones occidentales.[193]​\n\nEl gasto en el sistema de atención a la salud sobrepasa al de cualquier otra nación, tanto en términos de gasto per cápita como en porcentaje del PIB.[194]​ En 2000, la Organización Mundial de la Salud colocó el sistema de salud estadounidense en primer lugar en la capacidad de respuesta, pero 37.º en rendimiento global. Estados Unidos es líder en innovación médica. En 2004, este sector invirtió tres veces más que cualquier país de Europa en la investigación biomédica.[195]​\n\nEstados Unidos es sede de muchos de los mejores centros médicos del mundo. Gran parte de las instalaciones médicas son de propiedad privada que cuentan con algunos subsidios del gobierno local. A pesar de ser asociaciones sin fines de lucro, muchos de los hospitales más importantes del país están afiliados a grandes corporaciones o escuelas de medicina, que han hecho posible que anualmente estos centros alberguen a cerca del 70 % de todos los pacientes médicos del país.[196]​ El Hospital Johns Hopkins, la Clínica Mayo, el Hospital General de Massachusetts y la Clínica Cleveland se encuentran entre los mejores hospitales del país y del mundo.[197]​\n\nA diferencia de otros países desarrollados, la cobertura del sistema de salud no es universal. En 2004, los seguros médicos pagaron el 36 % de los gastos en materia de salud y los gobiernos federales y estatales otorgaron el 44 %.[198]​ En 2005, 46.6 millones de estadounidenses, 15.9 % de la población, no estaban asegurados, 5.4 millones más que en 2001. La principal causa de este aumento es la caída en el número de empleos donde se garantiza el seguro médico.[199]​ El tema de los estadounidenses no asegurados es una cuestión política importante.[200]​[201]​ Un estudio de 2009 estimó que la falta de seguros está asociada con casi 45 000 muertes al año.[202]​ En 2006, Massachusetts se convirtió en el primer estado en implementar la asistencia sanitaria universal.[203]​ La ley federal aprobada a principios de 2010 creará un sistema de salud casi universal para todo el país en 2014.[cita requerida]\n\nDelincuencia y aplicación de la ley\n\nSegún datos de 2020, Estados Unidos tiene una tasa de homicidios intencionales de 7 por cada 100 000 habitantes.[205]​ Un análisis transversal de la base de datos de mortalidad de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de 2010 mostró que las tasas de homicidio de Estados Unidos fueron 7 veces más altas que en otros países de altos ingresos, impulsadas por una tasa de homicidios con armas de fuego que fue 25.2 veces más alta.[206]​ Entre 1980 y 2008 los hombres cometieron el 77 % de los homicidios y el 90 % de los crímenes. La población negra se vio involucrada en el 52.5 % de los homicidios, una proporción ocho veces mayor que la población blanca (incluyendo a la mayoría de hispanos como «blancos») y fueron víctimas en una proporción seis veces mayor que los blancos. La mayoría de homicidios fueron entre personas de la misma etnia, ya que un 93 % de los negros fueron asesinados por negros y un 84 % de los blancos por blancos.[207]​ De los países desarrollados, Estados Unidos es, con diferencia, el país que tiene un mayor índice de delitos con violencia, homicidios y violencia armada.[208]​ Un análisis de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de 2003 reveló que Estados Unidos «tenía una tasa de homicidios 6.9 veces superior a las tasas registradas en el resto de los países de ingresos altos, tasa impulsada al alza debido a que su tasa de homicidios por arma de fuego era 19.5 veces mayor».[209]​ El derecho a comprar y portar un arma de fuego, consagrado en la Segunda Enmienda a la Constitución, sigue siendo objeto de debate político y social.\n\nLa responsabilidad legal de aplicar y hacer cumplir las leyes en Estados Unidos recae principalmente en los cuerpos de policía local, en los alguaciles ―llamados sheriff o marshal, dependiendo del estado― y sus departamentos y en la policía estatal. A nivel federal existen varias agencias federales, como la Oficina Federal de Investigación (FBI) y el Cuerpo de Alguaciles de Estados Unidos, especializados en determinadas funciones.[210]​ A nivel federal y en casi todos los estados impera el derecho consuetudinario. En el país existen dos tipos de tribunales, los tribunales estatales, encargados de estudiar y juzgar delitos ordinarios, y los tribunales federales, encargados de juzgar ciertos delitos designados y resolver apelaciones procedentes de sentencias de tribunales estatales. Los acuerdos entre las partes es la forma más común de terminar los juicios, pues en la gran mayoría de casos penales se alcanza un acuerdo con el fiscal antes de celebrarse un juicio con jurado.[211]​[212]​\n\nLa pena de muerte sigue siendo un tipo de condena legalmente, y sigue contemplada para ciertos delitos federales y militares en 32 de los 50 estados del país.[213]​ Entre 1967 y 1977 no se realizó ninguna ejecución, debido, en parte, a un fallo de la Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos que prohibía la imposición arbitraria de la pena capital. En 1976, el mismo tribunal dictaminó que, en circunstancias adecuadas, la pena de muerte podía aplicarse sin que ello violara la legalidad constitucional. Desde esta decisión, Estados Unidos ha ejecutado a más de 1300 reos, la mayoría de ellos en Texas, Virginia y Oklahoma.[214]​ Por otro lado, son varios los estados que han ido aboliendo por ley o simplemente dejado de aplicar la pena de muerte. En 2010, Estados Unidos fue el quinto país en número de ejecuciones, detrás de tan solo China, Irán, Corea del Norte y Yemen.[215]​\n\nEstados Unidos es el país con una mayor tasa de encarcelamiento documentado del mundo y tiene la mayor población carcelaria del mundo.[216]​[217]​ A inicios de 2008, más de 2.3 millones de personas estaban encarceladas, más de uno de cada 100 adultos del país.[218]​ Entre presos y personas en libertad condicional, el sistema penitenciario supervisaba a uno de cada 31 adultos del país en 2010,[219]​ cifra que para 2012 se había rebajado a 1 de cada 35 adultos (la tasa más baja desde 1997), haciendo un total de 6 937 600 personas.[220]​ La población carcelaria se ha cuadruplicado desde 1980.[221]​ El coste de mantener a los presos y las instalaciones, sumado a la construcción de nuevas prisiones debido a la masificación, asciende a más de sesenta mil millones de dólares anuales; esto provoca que algunos estados del país tengan que destinar al sistema penitenciario un 10 % de sus ingresos, en el caso de California, estado a la cabeza en número de prisioneros, en el año 2010 dedicó más dinero a esta faceta que, por ejemplo, a educación.[219]​ Los presos más comunes son los varones afroamericanos, con una tasa de encarcelados tres veces mayor que los hispanos y seis veces mayor que la de los varones blancos.[222]​ La alta tasa de presos puede explicarse en parte por las duras leyes promulgadas durante las últimas décadas para combatir el tráfico, posesión y consumo de drogas.[223]​ En 2008 Luisiana fue el estado con mayor tasa de encarcelados y Maine el de menor tasa.[224]​\n\nEl sistema penitenciario de Estados Unidos es duramente criticado tanto por analistas como por algunas organizaciones. Además de la privatización progresiva del sistema penitenciario desde la década de 1980, en 2014 la ONG Human Rights Watch y otras organizaciones denunciaron que más de ochenta mil presos se encuentran en celdas de aislamiento minúsculas, que las ONG califican como cámaras de tortura.[225]​ En 2012, The New York Times denunció que unos sesenta mil indocumentados recluidos en centros de detención son utilizados como mano de obra barata por el gobierno o empresas privadas, con salarios que pueden llegar a ser de 13 centavos la hora; en algunos casos ni siquiera se les retribuye.[226]​ Algunos estados también emplean a miles de reclusos de sus prisiones en fábricas de algunas empresas a cambio de la reducción de su condena o el salario mínimo. Esto supone un ahorro para las empresas de millones de dólares al año en salarios, aunque su legalidad está cuestionada.[227]​ Algunas de las empresas involucradas serían, directamente o a través de subcontrataciones, Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks o Victoria’s Secret, entre otras.[227]​\n\nEstados Unidos es una nación multicultural, hogar de una amplia variedad de grupos étnicos, tradiciones y valores.[14]​[228]​ Aparte de las ahora pequeñas poblaciones de nativos americanos y hawaianos, casi todos los estadounidenses o sus antepasados emigraron durante los últimos cinco siglos. ​ La cultura común para la mayoría de los estadounidenses es una cultura occidental, que en gran parte proviene de las tradiciones de los inmigrantes europeos con influencias de muchas otras fuentes, tales como las tradiciones traídas por los esclavos de África.[14]​ ​ ​ Recientemente, los inmigrantes de Asia y Latinoamérica han añadido más elementos a esta mezcla cultural que ha sido descrita como «un crisol de razas homogeneizados y en una ensaladera heterogénea», en donde los inmigrantes y sus descendientes retienen, comparten y absorben varias características culturales distintivas.[14]​\n\nDe acuerdo con un análisis de dimensiones culturales elaborado por Geert Hofstede, Estados Unidos tiene uno de los índices de individualismo más alto que cualquier otro país estudiado.[232]​ Mientras que en la cultura popular se considera al país como una sociedad sin clases sociales, ​ varios estudiosos identifican diferencias significativas que pueden considerarse como clases sociales, que afectan a la socialización, el idioma y los valores.[234]​[235]​ La clase media trabajadora estadounidense ha sido la iniciadora de muchas de las tendencias sociales contemporáneas como el feminismo moderno, el ecologismo y el multiculturalismo.[236]​ A diferencia de otras culturas, la mayoría de las mujeres trabajan fuera del hogar y cuenta con alguna licenciatura.[237]​ En 2007, 58 % de las estadounidenses mayores de 18 años se habían casado, 6 % estaban viudas, 10 % se divorciaron y el 25 % nunca se había casado.[238]​\n\nEl mismo estudio de Hofstede también reveló que el punto de vista social de los estadounidenses, sus expectativas culturales y la imagen que tienen de sí mismos están asociadas con sus empleos y ocupaciones en un grado inusitadamente estrecho.[239]​ Así también se tiene la tendencia a valorar más los logros socioeconómicos, de tal modo que el hecho de ser una persona ordinaria o promedio es visto como un atributo positivo en la mayoría de los casos.[240]​ Pese a que el llamado «sueño americano» y la percepción de que los estadounidenses disfrutan de una alta movilidad social desempeñan un papel clave en la atracción de los inmigrantes, algunos analistas encuentran que Estados Unidos tiene una menor movilidad social que los países de Europa y Canadá.[241]​[242]​\n\nDesde la colonización europea, el arte estadunidense se mantuvo apegado a las corrientes artísticas del Viejo Continente. A mediados del siglo XIX, surgió la Escuela del río Hudson, uno de los primeros movimientos artísticos desarrollado en el país, aunque todavía se encontraba muy influenciado por la tradición europea del naturalismo. En 1913, el Armory Show de la ciudad de Nueva York, una exhibición de obras del arte moderno europeo, causó un gran impacto en el público y transformó la escena artística estadunidense.[243]​ Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley y otros artistas experimentaron con nuevos estilos, mostrando una sensibilidad y técnica sin precedentes en los artistas europeos. Los movimientos artísticos más importantes como el expresionismo abstracto de Jackson Pollock y Willem de Kooning y el pop art de Andy Warhol y Roy Lichtenstein se desarrollaron en gran medida en los Estados Unidos. De igual forma, la corriente del modernismo y el posmodernismo llevaron a la fama a varios arquitectos estadounidenses como Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson y Frank Gehry.\n\nUno de los más grandes promotores del teatro en Estados Unidos fue el empresario P. T. Barnum, quien se introdujo en el negocio del entretenimiento del bajo Manhattan en 1841. A finales de la década de 1870, el equipo Harrigan and Hart produjo una serie de comedias musicales muy exitosas en Nueva York. En el siglo XX, el formato para los musicales modernos emergió de Broadway; las canciones compuestas por personajes como Irving Berlin, Cole Porter y Stephen Sondheim se convirtieron en estándares para la música pop. El dramaturgo Eugene O'Neill ganó el Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1936; otros escritores estadounidenses aclamados incluyen a ganadores de un Premio Pulitzer, como Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee y August Wilson.\n\nCoreógrafos como Isadora Duncan y Martha Graham ayudaron al desarrollo de la danza moderna, mientras que George Balanchine y Jerome Robbins fueron dos de las grandes figuras del ballet del siglo XX. Los estadounidenses han jugado un papel importante en el medio artístico de la fotografía, destacando entre ellos Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen y Ansel Adams.\n\nLa primera función de cine en la historia se realizó en 1894 en la ciudad de Nueva York, utilizando el quinetoscopio de Thomas Edison. El año siguiente fue presentada la primera proyección de una película con fines comerciales, también en Nueva York, y durante las décadas siguientes Estados Unidos estuvo a la vanguardia del desarrollo del cine sonoro. Desde principios del siglo XX, la industria del cine estadounidense se ha centrado en gran medida alrededor de las producciones de Hollywood, California. El director D. W. Griffith fue fundamental para el desarrollo de la estructura básica de una película y Citizen Kane (1941) de Orson Welles es citada frecuentemente como la mejor película de todos los tiempos.[244]​[245]​ Otros directores fundamentales de esta nacionalidad en la historia del cine: John Ford, Howard Hawks, Elia Kazan o Michael Curtiz, y, entre los más recientes, Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola o Steven Spielberg. Actores estadounidenses como Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne o Marilyn Monroe se han convertido en figuras icónicas, mientras que el productor y empresario Walt Disney fue uno de los líderes en la animación y el merchandising de sus películas. Los estudios de cine más importantes de Hollywood han producido las películas comercialmente más exitosas en la historia, tales como Star Wars (1977), Titanic (1997) o Avatar (2009). Para la década de 2020, los productos de Hollywood continuarán dominando la industria cinematográfica a nivel mundial.[246]​\n\nCon la historieta, la producción estadounidense ha perdido el liderazgo que ostentaba a nivel mundial desde principios del siglo XX, destacando varias tiras de prensa como Flash Gordon, The Phantom o El Príncipe Valiente. Luego de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el cómic se convirtió en un medio minoritario que recientemente vive el fenómeno de la novela gráfica, en el que destacan autores como Charles Burns, Joe Sacco o Chris Ware. No obstante, las tiras cómicas y las historietas también son parte del legado artístico del país. Por ejemplo, Superman, uno de los superhéroes más conocidos dentro de este medio, se ha convertido en todo un ícono nacional. ​\n\nEstados Unidos tiene la mayor cantidad de televidentes en el mundo,[248]​ a la vez que el promedio de tiempo dedicado a ella sigue en aumento, llegando a cinco horas al día en 2006.[249]​ Las cuatro cadenas de televisión más importantes son todas entidades comerciales. Los estadounidenses también escuchan programas de radio, en gran medida comercializados, en promedio durante dos y media horas al día.[250]​ Los sitios web y motores de búsqueda más populares de la red son inventiva estadounidense, incluidos Google, Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Blogger, eBay y Yahoo!.[251]​\n\nEn cuanto a la música, la obra de Charles Ives de la década de 1910, en gran parte ignorada durante su desarrollo, lo llevó a convertirse en el primer compositor de música clásica estadounidense exitoso; otros pioneros como Henry Cowell y John Cage crearon un enfoque estadounidense dentro de las composiciones clásicas. Aaron Copland y George Gershwin desarrollaron una mezcla única de música clásica con música popular.\n\nLos estilos rítmicos y líricos de la música afroamericana han influido profundamente en la música de Estados Unidos en general, distinguiéndola de las tradiciones europeas. Elementos de la música folclórica, como el blues y lo que ahora se conoce como old music fueron adaptados y transformados en géneros populares para una audiencia global. El jazz fue desarrollado por artistas innovadores tales como Louis Armstrong y Duke Ellington a principios del siglo XX. El country surgió en la década de 1920 y el rhythm and blues en la década de 1940. A mediados de la siguiente década, Elvis Presley y Chuck Berry estuvieron entre los pioneros del rock and roll. En la década de 1960, el surgimiento de la carrera de Bob Dylan ayudó a revivir la influencia de la música folclórica, para convertirse en uno de los compositores más célebres del país; al mismo tiempo, James Brown lideró el desarrollo del funk. Las más recientes creaciones estadounidenses incluyen el hip hop y la música house. Finalmente, estrellas de la música popular estadounidense como Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift e Eminem se han convertido en celebridades mundiales. ​\n\nDurante el siglo XVIII y principios del siglo XIX, la literatura estadunidense tomaba la mayoría de sus influencias de Europa. A mediados del siglo XIX, escritores como Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe y Henry David Thoreau establecieron una literatura propia del país. Mark Twain y el poeta Walt Whitman fueron dos de las grandes figuras de la segunda mitad del siglo; Emily Dickinson, virtualmente desconocida durante su vida, también es considerada como una de las poetisas más importantes de la literatura estadounidense. ​ Una obra que captura aspectos fundamentales de la vida en el país en sus personajes ―tales como Moby-Dick (1851) de Herman Melville, Las aventuras de Huckleberry Finn (1885) de Mark Twain y El gran Gatsby (1925) de F. Scott Fitzgerald― puede ser considerada como la «gran novela estadounidense».\n\nOnce ciudadanos estadounidenses han ganado el Premio Nobel de Literatura, siendo el más reciente Toni Morrison en 1993. William Faulkner y Ernest Hemingway, ganadores en los años 1949 y 1954, respectivamente, a menudo son catalogados entre los escritores más influyentes del siglo XX. ​ Varios géneros literarios populares como los del viejo oeste y la novela negra se desarrollaron en el país. Los escritores de la generación beat (Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs…) abrieron el campo a nuevas formas literarias, así como a autores posmodernistas como John Barth, Thomas Pynchon y Don DeLillo. Merece la pena mencionar asimismo a otros poetas y escritores tan importantes como Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, el nacionalizado Vladimir Nabokov, Raymond Carver, y, dentro de la literatura fantástica, son de renombre internacional H. P. Lovecraft, Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, etc.\n\nEn el campo de la filosofía, los trascendentalistas, liderados por Henry Thoreau y Ralph Waldo Emerson, establecieron el primer movimiento filosófico importante del país. Después de la Guerra de Secesión, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James y John Dewey fueron los líderes del desarrollo del pragmatismo. En el siglo XX, las obras de W. V. O. Quine, Richard Rorty y Noam Chomsky, trajeron la filosofía analítica a las academias estadounidenses. En décadas más recientes, John Rawls y Robert Nozick fueron dos de los líderes más importantes del resurgimiento de la filosofía política.\n\nLa gastronomía de Estados Unidos es similar a la de otros países occidentales, con el trigo siendo el cereal más utilizado. La cocina tradicional estadunidense utiliza ingredientes como el pavo, carne de ciervo, papas, camotes, maíz, calabazas, miel de maple y otros elementos indígenas utilizados por los amerindios y los primeros colonizadores europeos. Parrilladas de puerco y res, tortas de cangrejo, papas chips y las galletas con chispas de chocolate son algunos de los platos hechos al «estilo estadounidense». La soul food, la cocina tradicional de los esclavos africanos, es aún popular en el sur y entre los afroamericanos de otras partes del país. Las gastronomías sincréticas, como la cocina criolla de Luisiana, la cajún y la tex-mex, tienen gran importancia regional.\n\nPlatos característicos como la tarta de manzana, el pollo frito, la pizza, la hamburguesa y el perrito caliente provienen de recetas introducidas por los inmigrantes. Las papas fritas, los platillos mexicanos como los burritos y tacos y los platillos con pastas adaptados de recetas italianas también son ampliamente consumidos.[255]​ En el consumo de bebidas, los estadounidenses prefieren el café en vez del té. La publicidad de las industrias estadounidenses ha hecho que el jugo de naranja y la leche sean las bebidas típicas de un desayuno. ​ ​ El consumo frecuente de comida rápida está asociado con lo que los médicos llaman «epidemia de obesidad». Las gaseosas son ampliamente populares: el azúcar contenido en ellas aporta el 9 % de la ingesta calórica promedio.[258]​[259]​\n\nEstados Unidos es pionero en la investigación científica y la innovación tecnológica desde el siglo XIX. En 1876, Alexander Graham Bell recibió la primera patente para un estadounidense por el teléfono.[260]​ El laboratorio de Thomas Edison desarrolló el fonógrafo, la primera lámpara incandescente y el primer proyector de películas. Nikola Tesla fue precursor en experimentar con la corriente alterna, el motor de corriente alterna y la radio. En el siglo XX, las compañías de automóviles de Ransom Eli Olds y Henry Ford promovieron la producción en cadena. En 1903, los hermanos Wright realizaron el primer vuelo propulsado en su aeronave Wright Flyer.[261]​\n\nEl ascenso del nazismo en la década de 1930 llevó a muchos científicos europeos, incluyendo a Albert Einstein y Enrico Fermi, a emigrar al país. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el proyecto Manhattan ya había desarrollado las primeras armas nucleares, anunciando el inicio de la era nuclear. La carrera espacial también produjo avances rápidos en la construcción y el desarrollo de cohetes, la ciencia de materiales y la informática. El país fue responsable del desarrollo de la ARPANET y su sucesor, Internet. Hoy en día, la mayor parte de los ingresos para la investigación y desarrollo, un 64%, provienen del sector privado.[262]​ El país es líder mundial en publicaciones de investigación científica y en el factor de impacto.[263]​ Los estadounidenses poseen bienes de consumo tecnológicamente avanzados[264]​[265]​[266]​ y casi la mitad de los hogares tienen acceso a Internet de banda ancha.[267]​ También es el principal desarrollador y cultivador de organismos genéticamente modificados; más de la mitad de las tierras con cultivos biotecnológicos del mundo se encuentran en Estados Unidos.[268]​\n\nSegún el Índice Mundial de Innovación, a cargo de la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual, en su versión 2024, Estados Unidos se ubica en el tercer lugar de dicho índice.[269]​ Desde 2023, fue desplazado del segundo lugar que ocupó en 2022, por Suecia.[270]​ [271]​[272]​ En ediciones anteriores a 2022, de este índice, Estados Unidos obtuvo la posición número 3, en los cuales el primer lugar ha sido siempre ocupado por Suiza.[273]​[274]​\n\nDesde finales del siglo XIX, el béisbol se considera como el deporte nacional, mientras que el fútbol americano, el baloncesto y el hockey sobre hielo son los otros tres grandes deportes de conjunto a nivel profesional. Las ligas universitarias también atraen a grandes audiencias. El fútbol americano es el deporte más popular en Estados Unidos.[276]​[277]​ El boxeo y las carreras de caballos fueron en su momento los deportes individuales más vistos, pero han sido eclipsados por el golf y el automovilismo, particularmente por los campeonatos Stock Cars como la más importante Copa NASCAR y otras categorías nacionales y regionales de NASCAR y ARCA. Otros campeonatos de monoplazas reseñables son la IndyCar, anteriormente la desaparecida Championship Auto Racing Teams y las carreras de resistencia como la United SportsCar Championship. Una de las principales carreras de Estados Unidos son las 500 Millas de Indianapolis de la IndyCar, que cuenta con prestigio internacional. Las carreras de resistencia como las 24 Horas de Daytona, 12 Horas de Sebring y la Petit Le Mans son de igual importancia en el automovilismo mundial. Las 500 millas de Daytona de la copa NASCAR es la carrera más importante de los Stock Cars del mundo. El fútbol, aunque no es uno de los principales deportes a nivel profesional en el país, tiene gran presencia y nivel de aficionados. El tenis y otros deportes de exterior también son populares junto al Abierto de Estados Unidos, uno de los campeonatos de tenis más vistos del mundo.\n\nSi bien la mayoría de los deportes importantes de los Estados Unidos han evolucionado de prácticas europeas, el baloncesto, el voleibol, la animación y el snowboarding son invenciones locales. El lacrosse y el surf surgieron de los amerindios y de los nativos de Hawái.\n\nEl Comité Olímpico de los Estados Unidos (USOC) fue anfitrión de los Juegos Olímpicos de Verano en cuatro ocasiones: San Luis 1904, Los Ángeles 1932, Los Ángeles 1984 y Atlanta 1996, y de los Juegos de Invierno en cuatro ocasiones: Lake Placid 1932, Squaw Valley 1960, Lake Placid 1980 y Salt Lake City 2002.[278]​ Estados Unidos organizará los juegos de verano de 2028 en Los Ángeles y los de invierno de 2034 en Salt Lake City. Estados Unidos ha ganado 2781 medallas en los Juegos Olímpicos de Verano, más que ningún otro país y 330 medallas en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno.[279]​\n• Anexo:Patrimonio de la Humanidad en Estados Unidos\n• Anexo:Banderas de los Estados Unidos de América\n• Anexo:Presidentes de los Estados Unidos\n• Estado de los Estados Unidos de América\n• Medios de comunicación en Estados Unidos\n• None .

It was a Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement and a major market town from those times through Norman and medieval times to the present day. It is the seat of the Church of England Diocese of Chichester and is home to a 12th-century cathedral.\n\nThe city has two main watercourses: the Chichester Canal and the River Lavant. The Lavant, a winterbourne, runs to the south of the city walls; it is hidden mostly in culverts when close to the city centre.\n\nThere is no recorded evidence that Chichester was a settlement of any size before the coming of the Romans.[6] The area around Chichester is believed to have played a significant part during the Roman invasion of AD 43, as confirmed by evidence of military storage structures in the area of the nearby Fishbourne Roman Palace.[7] The city centre stands on the foundations of the Romano-British city of Noviomagus Reginorum, capital of the Civitas Reginorum.[8][9]\n\nThe Roman road of Stane Street, connecting the city with London, started at the east gate, while the Chichester to Silchester road started from the north gate. The plan of the city is inherited from the Romans: the North, South, East and West shopping streets radiate from the central market cross dating from medieval times.\n\nThe original Roman city wall was over 6+1⁄2 feet (2.0 m) thick with a steep ditch (which was later used to divert the River Lavant). The lower parts of the existing city walls are Roman, but most of the above-ground work is later.\n\nThe city was also home to some Roman baths, found down Tower Street when preparation for a new car park was underway. A museum, The Novium, preserving the baths was opened on 8 July 2012.\n\nAn amphitheatre was built outside the city walls, close to the East Gate, in around 80 AD. The area is now a park, but the site of the amphitheatre is discernible as a gentle bank approximately oval in shape; a notice board in the park gives more information.\n\nIn January 2017, archaeologists using underground radar reported the discovery of the relatively untouched ground floor of a Roman townhouse and outbuilding. The exceptional preservation is due to the fact the site, Priory Park, belonged to a monastery and has never been built upon since Roman times.[10]\n\nThe legendary foundation of Anglo-Saxon Chichester is described by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that says that the area was annexed towards the close of the fifth century, by Ælle and his three sons. The city was supposedly renamed after his son, Cissa. It also says that it was the principal city of the Kingdom of Sussex. However, the foundation story is regarded as a myth by historians as there is no archaeological evidence that Chichester was reoccupied after the Romans left until the 9th century.[11][12]\n\nIn the 9th century Alfred the Great set about building a system of fortified towns or forts, known as burhs, in response to the Viking threat. This included old Roman settlements where the walls could be rebuilt and strengthened. Chichester was one of these and was rebuilt probably between 878 and 879. The Burghal Hidage is an Anglo-Saxon document that provides a list of over thirty burhs, mainly in the ancient Kingdom of Wessex, and the taxes (recorded as numbers of hides) assigned for their maintenance. For each five hides the town was expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the burhs and to help in their initial construction and upkeep. Chichester was one of the larger burhs and was rated at 1500 hides.[13][14]\n\nThe system was supported by a communication network based on hilltop beacons to provide early warning. It has been suggested that one such link ran from Chichester to London.[15][16]\n\nFollowing the Norman Conquest in 1066, the cathedral that had been founded in 681 at Selsey was moved to Chichester after the Council of London of 1075 decreed that Sees should be centred in cities.[17]\n\nWhen the Domesday Book of 1086 was compiled, Cicestre[18] in the Hundred of Stockbridge (comprising 102 households across the five areas outside the city)[19] comprised 300 dwellings which held a population of 1,500 people, and had an annual value of 25 pounds. There was a mill named Kings Mill that would have been rented to local slaves and villeins. After the Battle of Hastings the township of Chichester was handed to Roger de Mongomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, for courageous efforts in the battle, but it was forfeited in 1104 by the 3rd Earl. Shortly after 1066 Chichester Castle was built by Roger de Mongomerie to consolidate Norman power.[20] In around 1143 the title Earl of Arundel (also known as the Earl of Sussex until that title fell out of use) was created and became the dominant local landowner. In 1216, Chichester Castle, along with Reigate Castle, was captured by the French, but regained the following year, when the castle was ordered to be destroyed by the king.[21] Between 1250 and 1262, the Rape of Chichester was created from the western half of Arundel rape, with the castle as its administrative centre.[22]\n\nIn about 1400 Bishop Robert Reed erected a cross in the Market Place.[23]\n\nAt Christmas 1642 during the First English Civil War, the city was besieged and St Pancras church was destroyed by gunfire.[24]\n\nA military presence was established in the city in 1795 with the construction of a depot on land where the Hawkhurst Gang had been hanged. It was named the Roussillon Barracks in 1958.[25]\n\nThe military presence had mostly ceased by 2014 and the site was being developed for housing.[26] with the former Guardroom known as The Keep playing host to a detachment of the Army Cadet Force.[27]\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th-century, Chichester's livestock market was recorded as the second largest in the country.[28]\n\nChichester was bombed by the Luftwaffe during World War II, but fared relatively well compared to larger English cities.[29][30] On 11 May 1944, a United States Army Air Forces Consolidated B-24 Liberator crashed in the city, killing three, injuring 38, and damaging hundreds of local buildings.[31]\n\nA new West Sussex county library was built in Tower Street in 1967, designed by county architect FR Steele. This was listed at Grade II in 2015.[32]\n\nIn December 1993 and January 1994, Chichester was affected by the 1993–94 West Sussex floods.[33]\n\nOn 21 November 2017, the Chichester District Council adopted a 'Southern Gateway' plan to redevelop an area from the law courts to the canal basin, including the two railway level crossings.[34][35]\n\nHistorically, Chichester was a city and liberty,[6] thereby largely self-governing. Although it has retained its city status, in 1888 it became a municipal borough, transferring some powers to West Sussex administrative county. In 1974 the municipal borough became part of the much larger Chichester District. The City Council[36] was retained but it only has the powers of a parish council; control of services is largely in the hands of Chichester District Council and West Sussex County Council.\n\nThe City Council meets in the Council House on North Street, which dates from 1731.[37] Prior to this the City Council, and its predecessor the City Corporation, had met in Chichester Guildhall. In addition to its own council offices, those of the Chichester District and the West Sussex County Council are located in the city.\n\nThe City Council consists of eighteen elected members serving five wards of the city – North, South, East, West, and Central.[38] Elections to the City Council last took place on Thursday 5 May 2023.[39] The current makeup of the City Council is shown below - those marked * are also Chichester District Councillors.\n\nChichester is represented in the House of Commons by the Chichester constituency, held since the 2024 General Election by Jess Brown-Fuller.[40] From 1660 to 1868, Chichester returned two members of Parliament, this was reduced to one member by the Reform Act 1867. The Conservative Party is dominant, with the constituency returning a Conservative member at every election since 1868, with the exception of the Liberal Charles Rudkin in 1923. Between 1812 and 1894 the constituency was represented exclusively by members of the Lennox family.[41]\n\nThe following people and organisations have received the Freedom of the City of Chichester.\n\nThe City of Chichester is located on the River Lavant south of its gap through the South Downs. This winterbourne for part of its course now runs through the city in underground culverts.[51] The city's site made it an ideal place for settlement, with many ancient routeways converging here. The oldest section lies within the medieval walls of the city, which are built on Roman foundations.[52]\n\nThe Chichester conservation area, designated for its architectural and historic interest,[53] encompasses the whole of the Roman town, and includes many Grade I and II listed buildings. Further to the north lies the separate conservation area around the former Graylingwell Hospital, and to the south, the Chichester Conservation Area has been extended recently to include the newly restored canal basin and part of Chichester Canal itself. The Conservation Area has been split into eight 'character' areas, based on historic development, building type, uses and activities.\n\nChichester has a maritime climate. With its position in southern England, Chichester has mild winters and cool summers. West Sussex has high sunshine levels compared with other parts of the UK with around 1,900 hours annually.[54]\n\nThe 2011 census recorded a population of 26,795 for the city of Chichester, forming 12,316 households.[55] The 2021 census recorded an increase in population to 29,407, forming 13,263 households. There is a small imbalance in the sex ratio, with 15,701, female residents (53.3%) and 13,706 male residents (46.7%). 26,622 residents (91%) listed their ethnic group as white.[2]\n\nChichester has one of the highest rates of empty homes in England, with 1 in every 17 houses vacant. In October 2020, 3,444 houses were vacant, of which 3,302 were second homes.[56]\n\nThe city has a tourist industry.[57] Several marinas are situated in the area together with related industries. A recent government study suggested that the area has a lot of employment with the public sector (as well as within the tourism and leisure industries), with a growing number of self-employed people in the area.[58]\n\nThe city holds an annual four-week arts and music festival (\"Festival of Chichester\") held in June and July.[59]\n\nChichester Cathedral has a year-round programme of music, talks and other events, including free lunchtime concerts of classical music.\n\nChichester Festival Theatre, is one of the United Kingdom's flagship producing and touring theatres, whose annual summer season attracts actors, writers and directors from the West End theatre and the USA.[60]\n\nPallant House Gallery, winner of the 2007 gallery of the year Gulbenkian Prize, has a major collection of chiefly modern British art and in 2006 opened a new extension that houses the collection of Sir Colin St John Wilson. It has a changing programme of exhibitions.[61]\n\nChichester is home to the South Downs Planetarium & Science Centre, which opened in 2001 and features a program of public star shows in its 100-seat theatre.\n\nThe Sloe Fair, a funfair that dates back to the 12th Century, is held annually on 20 October in the city's Northgate car park.[62]\n\nChichester Cinema at New Park[63] is the city's first and only arthouse cinema. It shows a selection of mainstream, small-budget and older films 7 days a week. It hosts an annual 18-day International Film Festival in August/September. Vice-presidents are Maggie Smith and Kenneth Branagh. There is a larger, multiplex cinema located at Chichester Gate. Chichester's previous cinemas were the Olympia Electric on Northgate (1911–1922), the Plaza Cinema on South Street (1920–1960, the Odeon from 1945 and now Iceland supermarket), the Granada Exchange at the Corn Exchange (1922–1980) and the Gaumont on Eastgate Square (1937–1961, later the swimming baths).[64]\n\nThe Chichester Open Mic has supported regular programmes of readings by contemporary poets in the city since 2010. It also hosts a high-profile annual event under the banner Poetry and All That Jazz which included performances by Don Paterson in 2010, Sam Willetts in 2011, and David Harsent in 2012.[65]\n\nIn 2012 The Novium, Chichester's museum, was opened by author Kate Mosse.[66] Designed by the architect Keith Williams, is approximately 2.4 times the size of the previous museum in Little London. Key highlights are Roman Bath House, Jupiter Stone and Chilgrove Mosaic.\n\nIn May 2013 Chichester hosted the Chichester Street Art Festival week where international street artists created colourful murals around the city.[67]\n\nChichester is mentioned in a 1992 episode of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, the 2003 film Bright Young Things directed by Stephen Fry, the 2005 film Stoned about Brian Jones from the Rolling Stones, and also in the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes. The city is periodically referred to in Call the Midwife, as the seat of the Order of Saint Raymond Nonnatus, the mother house's exterior being depicted in episode 1.6.\n\nThe West Sussex Record Office is in Orchard Street and contains the county archives. On 21 April 2017 it was announced that a second parchment manuscript copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, now termed The Sussex Declaration, had been discovered in the archives.[68][69]\n\nChichester has one of the highest rates of empty homes in England, with 1 in every 17 houses vacant. In October 2020, 3,444 houses were vacant, of which 3,302 were second homes.[56]\n\nFounded in 1881, the Chichester Symphony Orchestra has both amateur and professional players. Three concerts are given each year with the summer concert being part of the Chichester Festivities while the autumn concert is included in the Chichester Cathedral Lunchtime Series.[70] The Chichester Singers, under musical director Jonathan Willcocks, perform classical and contemporary works in concert.[71][72]\n\nThe Chichester RAJF (From \"Real Ale and Jazz Festival\"), was a four-day festival of music and real ale held each July in tents beside the 13th century Guildhall in Priory Park.[73] Founded in 1980 by members of Chichester Hockey Club as a fund-raising event, the festival's early years focused on traditional jazz and featured performers such as Kenny Ball, Humphrey Lyttelton and Kenny Baker. In the 1990s blues and R&B were introduced and acts including Status Quo, Blondie, Boney M, Howard Jones, Go West, The Pretenders and Simple Minds played the festival up until its final staging, in 2011.[citation needed]\n\nThe City of Chichester has been twinned with Chartres, France, since February 1959 and Ravenna, Italy, since December 1996[74][75] and Speyer, Germany, since 2023.[76] Friendship links have also been established with Marktredwitz in Germany, Kursk in Russia and Valletta in Malta.[75]\n\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter.[77]\n\nChichester's local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 104.8 FM, Heart South on 96.7 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Sussex on 96.6 FM and community based radio stations V2 Radio which broadcast online and Chichester Hospital Radio that broadcast on 1431 AM from the St Richard's Hospital in the town.[78][79]\n\nThe city is served by the weekly newspaper Chichester Observer.[80]\n\nChichester Cross, which is a type of buttercross familiar in old market towns, was built in 1501 as a covered marketplace,[81] and stands at the intersection of the four main roads in the centre of the city.\n\nChichester Cathedral, formally known as the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Chichester. It is a Grade I listed building from 1075.\n\nThe Butter Market in North Street was designed by John Nash, and was opened in 1808 as a food and produce market.[82]\n\nThe Corn Exchange on East Street was built in 1833, one of the first in the country.[83] From the 1880s it was used for drama and entertainment and became a cinema from the 1910s.[84] An attempt to convert it to a bingo hall was refused in 1977.[85] As it could not be converted to a multiplex it was closed on 9 August 1980.[85] It remained closed and unused for six years until the front was opened as a fast food restaurant and the rear converted for offices.[85][86] From 2005 the front has been used by a clothing retailer.[87]\n\nIn 1921, Sir William Robertson unveiled a war memorial in Eastgate Square for soldiers who died in World War I. The memorial was relocated to Litten Gardens in 1940. The city council subsequently added the names of soldiers who died in World War II.[88]\n\nChichester railway station, on the West Coastway line, has regular services to Brighton, London Victoria via Gatwick Airport, Portsmouth and Southampton.\n\nIn the past, there was a branch line to Midhurst in the north and a light railway, built by Colonel H. F. Stephens; it was known as the West Sussex Railway, which ran south to Selsey, and closed in 1935.\n\nChichester is the hub of several main roads. The most important of these is the A27 coastal trunk road, which connects Eastbourne with Southampton; it passes to the south of the city. The A27 connects Chichester to the M3, M27 and M275 motorways. The secondary coastal road, the A259, which begins its journey at Folkestone in Kent, joins the A27 here and ends in Havant to the west. Both of those roads make east–west connections.\n\nThree roads give Chichester access to the north: the A29 to London joins the A27 several miles to the east of the city; the A285 runs north-east to Petworth and beyond; and the A286 runs northwards towards Haslemere, Surrey.[89]\n\nChichester bus station, which is adjacent to the railway station, is the local hub for bus services. Operators include Stagecoach in the South Downs and Compass Travel.[90][91]\n\nChichester/Goodwood Airport is situated north of the city.[89]\n\nThere are several long-distance routes for walkers, cyclists and riders in the area; some of these routes, like the Centurion Way to West Dean, start here. Centurion Way was opened in the mid-1990s and runs along the former railway line.

It offers a range of A-Level and vocational courses. Bishop Luffa School sixth form also offers a range of A-Level courses and Chichester College, formerly Chichester College of Arts, Science and Technology; offers both foundation-level and degree-equivalent courses, mainly focused towards vocational qualifications for industry.[citation needed]\n\nThe University of Chichester[95] was granted degree-awarding body status by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in October 2005.[96]\n\nChichester Cathedral, founded in the 11th century, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and contains a shrine to Saint Richard of Chichester. Its spire, built of the weak local stone, collapsed and was rebuilt during the 19th century. In the south aisle of the cathedral a glass panel in the floor enables a view of the remains of a Roman mosaic pavement. The cathedral is unusual in Britain in having a separate bell tower a few metres away from the main building, rather than integrated into it. Within the cathedral there is a medieval tomb of a knight and his wife, the inspiration of the poem \"An Arundel Tomb\", by Philip Larkin. A memorial statue exists of William Huskisson, once member of parliament for the city, but best remembered as the first man to be run over by a railway engine.[97] Leonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms were commissioned for the cathedral.\n\nIn addition to the cathedral there are five Church of England churches, St Richard's Roman Catholic church and nine religious buildings of other denominations.[98] Redundant churches include the Grade I-listed St John the Evangelist's Church, an octagonal white-brick proprietary chapel with an impressive three-decker pulpit.[99][100]\n\nSt Mary's Hospital Almshouses are a 13th-century religious foundation located at St Martin's Square, providing housing and care for elderly people from the Chichester diocese.[101]\n\nChichester City F.C. is the main football club and is based at Oaklands Park. They play in the Isthmian League South East Division.[102] The rugby club, Chichester R.F.C., is also based at Oaklands Park.[103]\n\nChichester is also host to a Detachment of the Army Cadet Force who meet several times a week at the detachment located within the former Roussilon Barracks.[108][109]\n\nThe city is home to the Chichester Sharks Flag American Football Club who are members of the BAFA National League.[110]\n\nChichester Runners and A.C. is a club with runners and athletes of all ages. Other sports include cycling.[111]\n\nWilliam Juxon, born 1582, attended The Prebendal School before studying at Oxford. He became chaplain to Charles I and was the last English cleric to hold both church and secular high office. He became Archbishop of Canterbury following the Restoration.[112] William Cawley, born 1602 in Chichester, was on the other side of the English Civil War. Also educated at Oxford University he became the Member of Parliament for Chichester in 1628 and for Midhurst in 1640. He was a regicide and served on the Council of State during the Commonwealth, being forced to flee to Switzerland after the Restoration.[113] A later MP for the town, William Huskisson was the first widely reported person to die in a railway accident, when he was run over by Stephenson's Rocket at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. In modern times middle-distance runner Christopher Chataway was elected to Parliament in 1969.[114]\n\nMilitary people have included Edric Gifford, 3rd Baron Gifford who won a Victoria Cross during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War. General Charles Harington Harington served in the Second Boer War and as a staff officer throughout World War I,[115] and military theorist Major General J. F. C. Fuller planned the first large scale tank assault at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917.[116]\n\nArtists who were born or lived most of their lives in Chichester include Richard Buckner, Heywood Hardy, James Hayllar, William Shayer and George Smith.[117][118] Author Kate Mosse (born 1961) studied at Chichester High School For Girls, living in Chichester until moving to Oxford to attend New College. She is author of the first main-stage new play by a woman at Chichester Festival Theatre, an adaptation of her novel The Taxidermist's Daughter, set in and around Chichester.[119]\n\nTim Peake, who became the first official British astronaut when he arrived on the International Space Station in December 2015, was born in Chichester in 1972.

Fresh, healthful, and pure. With a focus on ingredients that are natural and sustainable; both sourced locally and imported from the sun-kissed islands and rugged mountains of Greece. Greca Mediterranean Kitchen + Bar is a concept 2,500 years in the making; steeped in tradition while exploring new creative paths forged from those traditions. Fresh fish flown from the Aegean is featured alongside succulent char-grilled meats that are at the center of a Greek festive table. Octopus, tender and rich, is served over a bed of Santorini fava (yellow lentil spread) with local tomatoes and red onions; tzatziki made with locally-sourced yogurt produced by a third-generation Greek dairy farmer is lovingly made in the authentic way (strained through cheesecloth); and loukaniko (village pork sausage) is infused with orange peel, as is the custom in the Peloponnese.\n\n In Greek culture, food is at the center of our lives, with every home producing it’s own culinary genius, very often known by the name “yiayia”. Among Greeks, food is made with love, with great thought and care given to each ingredient. Food is an extension of hospitality, a concept so important to Greeks that the word’s literal translation is “love of strangers”. For us, each meal, then, is a celebration; bringing together loved ones, old friends and new friends. Shared plates (whether meze or feasting platters), bottles of wine and cocktails crafted from the unique spirit heritage of Greece, are an invitation to commune with one another; to laugh, sing, imbibe and savor."}

Fue identificado como objeto nebuloso por primera vez por Edmond Halley en 1677. Este cúmulo orbita a través de nuestra galaxia, la Vía Láctea, siendo el más grande y brillante de los cúmulos globulares que la orbitan, su masa es de 4 millones de masas solares.[1]​ Omega Centauri también es el segundo cúmulo globular más masivo del grupo local de galaxias, solo Mayall II es más masivo. Es uno de los pocos (y el más brillante) que pueden ser observados a simple vista desde la Tierra. Omega Centauri está a unos 17 000 años luz (5 212.22 pc) de la Tierra y contiene varios millones de estrellas de Población II. Las estrellas de su centro están tan próximas entre sí que se cree que se encuentran a tan solo 0,1 años luz las unas de las otras. Su edad estimada es de cerca de 12 000 millones de años. Contiene alrededor de 10 millones de estrellas.\n\nA pesar de no ser realmente una estrella de la constelación del Centauro, recibió la letra griega ω en la denominación de Bayer como si lo fuera. Una característica que lo distingue de los demás cúmulos globulares de nuestra galaxia es que contiene estrellas de distintas generaciones. Por este motivo se especula que Omega Centauri puede ser el remanente del núcleo de una galaxia enana que fue satélite de nuestra Vía Láctea. Esta galaxia tendría un tamaño cientos de veces superior al actual de Omega Centauri y fue disgregada y absorbida por nuestra galaxia. La química y la dinámica de Omega Centauri son consistentes con esta hipótesis.\n\nAl igual que Mayall II, Omega Centauri presenta un rango de metalicidades y de edades estelares que llevan a pensar que no se formó de una sola vez (al contrario de lo que es normal en la mayoría de los cúmulos globulares).[2]​\n\nCuando se observa a simple vista en un sitio muy oscuro se puede ver del tamaño de la Luna llena[3]​ en el hemisferio sur, es circumpolar desde la latitud 43° sur y por lo tanto solo se eleva sobre el horizonte en el hemisferio norte hasta la latitud 43° norte (latitud de Toronto).\n\nEn 150 d. C., Ptolomeo catalogó este objeto estelar en su Almagesto como \"una estrella en el lomo del caballo\", (Quae est in principio scapulae). En 1603, Johann Bayer, en su Uranometria, utilizó los datos de Ptolomeo para denominarla Omega Centauri.[4]​ En 1677, Edmond Halley lo catalogó como objeto no-estelar en las observaciones que el astrónomo inglés realizó desde la isla de Santa Helena. Posteriormente, en 1715, Halley dijo de él que era una de las seis manchas o puntos luminosos en Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[5]​[6]​\n\nEn 1746, J.P. de Cheseaux la incluyó en su lista de 21 nebulosas. En 1755, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille le dio el número de catálogo L I.5. En 1826, James Dunlop lo reconoció como cúmulo globular y lo describió como un «bello globo estelar cuyas estrellas se concentraban de forma moderada y muy gradual hacia el centro».[6]​[7]​ como hizo el astrónomo francés Lacaille en 1755, de ahí que el número de catálogo se designe L I.5 .[8]​ Fue reconocido por primera vez como cúmulo globular por el astrónomo escocés James Dunlop en 1826, quien lo describió como un \"hermoso globo de estrellas muy gradual y moderadamente comprimido hacia el centro\".[9]​[10]​\n\nA una distancia aproximada de 17090 años luz (5,240 parsecs) de la Tierra, Omega Centauri es uno de los pocos cúmulos globulares visibles a simple vista, y parece casi tan grande como la Luna llena cuando se ve desde una zona rural oscura.[11]​ Es el más brillante, el más grande y, con 4 millones de masa solares,[12]​ el cúmulo globular más masivo conocido asociado a la Vía Láctea. De todos los cúmulos globulares del Grupo Local de galaxias, sólo Mayall II en la Galaxia de Andrómeda es más brillante y masivo.[13]​ Orbitando a través de la Vía Láctea, Omega Centauri contiene varios millones de estrellas de Población II y tiene unos 12 000 millones de años.[14]​\n\nLas estrellas del núcleo de Omega Centauri están tan amontonadas que se calcula que se encuentran a una distancia media de sólo 0,1 años luz unas de otras.[14]​ La dinámica interna se ha analizado utilizando mediciones de las velocidades radiales de 469 estrellas.[15]​ Los miembros de este cúmulo orbitan alrededor del centro de masa con una dispersión de velocidad máxima de 7,9 km s-1. La distribución de masa inferida a partir de la cinemática está ligeramente más extendida que la distribución de luminosidad, aunque no es fuertemente inconsistente con ella.\n\nUn estudio de 2008 presentó evidencia de un agujero negro de masa intermedia en el centro de Omega Centauri, basado en observaciones realizadas por el Telescopio Espacial Hubble y el Observatorio Gemini en Cerro Pachón en Chile.[16]​[17]​ La cámara avanzada para muestreos del Hubble mostró que las estrellas se agrupan cerca del centro de Omega Centauri, como lo demuestra el aumento gradual de la luz estelar cerca del centro. Usando instrumentos en el Observatorio Gemini para medir la velocidad de las estrellas que se arremolinan en el núcleo del cúmulo, E. Noyola y sus colegas encontraron que las estrellas más cercanas al núcleo se mueven más rápido que las estrellas más lejanas. Esta medida se interpretó en el sentido de que la materia invisible en el núcleo está interactuando gravitacionalmente con las estrellas cercanas. Al comparar estos resultados con modelos estándar, los astrónomos concluyeron que la causa más probable era la atracción gravitacional de un objeto denso y masivo como un agujero negro. Calcularon la masa del objeto en 40.000 masas solares.[16]​\n\nSin embargo, un trabajo más reciente ha desafiado estas conclusiones, en particular, disputando la ubicación propuesta del centro del cúmulo.[18]​[19]​ Los cálculos que utilizaron una ubicación revisada para el centro encontraron que la velocidad de las estrellas del núcleo no varía con la distancia, como se esperaría si estuviera presente un agujero negro de masa intermedia. Los mismos estudios también encontraron que la luz de las estrellas no aumenta hacia el centro, sino que permanece relativamente constante. Los autores señalaron que sus resultados no descartan por completo el agujero negro propuesto por Noyola y sus colegas, pero no lo confirman, y limitan su masa máxima a 12.000 masas solares.\n\nSe ha especulado que Omega Centauri es el núcleo de una galaxia enana que fue perturbada y absorbida por la Vía Láctea.[20]​ De hecho, se cree que la Estrella de Kapteyn, que actualmente se encuentra a sólo 13 años luz de la Tierra, tiene su origen en Omega Centauri.[21]​ La química y el movimiento de Omega Centauri en la Vía Láctea también concuerdan con esta imagen.[21]​ La química y el movimiento de Omega Centauri en la Vía Láctea también son coherentes con esta imagen.[21]​ Al igual que Mayall II, Omega Centauri tiene un rango de metalicidades y edades estelares que sugiere que no se formó todo a la vez (como se cree que se forman los cúmulos globulares) y que, de hecho, puede ser el resto del núcleo de una galaxia más pequeña incorporada hace tiempo a la Vía Láctea.[22]​\n\nLa novela Singularity (2012), de Ian Douglas, presenta como un hecho que Omega Centauri y Kapteyn's Star se originan en una galaxia enana perturbada, y este origen es central en la trama de la novela. A medida que avanza la historia, se discuten varios aspectos científicos de Omega Centauri, como el probable entorno de radiación dentro del cúmulo y el aspecto que podría tener el cielo desde el interior del cúmulo.[23]​\n\nEste cúmulo aparece en la serie de ciencia ficción alemana Perry Rhodan, y un ciclo de la serie derivada Atlan, está ambientado en Omega Centauri.\n• Omega Centauri en ESA/Hubble (inglés).

Located at a distance of 17,090 light-years (5,240 parsecs), it is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way at a diameter of roughly 150 light-years.[10] It is estimated to contain approximately 10 million stars, with a total mass of 4 million solar masses,[11] making it the most massive known globular cluster in the Milky Way.\n\nOmega Centauri is very different from most other galactic globular clusters to the extent that it is thought to have originated as the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy.[12]\n\nAround 150 AD, Greco-Roman writer and astronomer Ptolemy catalogued this object in his Almagest as a star on the centaur's back, \"Quae est in principio scapulae\". German cartographer Johann Bayer used Ptolemy's data to designate this object \"Omega Centauri\" with his 1603 publication of Uranometria.[13] Using a telescope from the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, English astronomer Edmond Halley observed this object in 1677, listing it as a non-stellar object. In 1716, it was published by Halley among his list of six \"luminous spots or patches\" in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[14][15]\n\nSwiss astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux included Omega Centauri in his 1746 list of 21 nebulae,[15][16] as did French astronomer Lacaille in 1755, whence the catalogue number is designated L I.5.[17] It was first recognized as a globular cluster by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop in 1826, who described it as a \"beautiful globe of stars very gradually and moderately compressed to the centre\".[18][19]\n\nAt a distance of about 17,000 light-years (5,200 parsecs) from Earth, Omega Centauri is one of the few globular clusters visible to the naked eye—and appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark, rural area.[20] It is the brightest, largest and, at 4 million solar masses,[6] the most massive-known globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. Of all the globular clusters in the Local Group of galaxies, only Mayall II in the Andromeda Galaxy is brighter and more massive.[21] Orbiting through the Milky Way, Omega Centauri contains several million Population II stars and is about 12 billion years old.[22]\n\nThe stars in the core of Omega Centauri are so crowded that they are estimated to average only 0.1 light-year away from each other.[22] The internal dynamics have been analyzed using measurements of the radial velocities of 469 stars.[23] The members of this cluster are orbiting the center of mass with a peak velocity dispersion of 7.9 km s−1. The mass distribution inferred from the kinematics is slightly more extended than, though not strongly inconsistent with, the luminosity distribution.[citation needed]\n\nA 2008 study presented evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of Omega Centauri, based on observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pachón in Chile.[24][25] Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys showed that stars are bunching up near the center of Omega Centauri, as evidenced by the gradual increase in starlight near the center. Using instruments at the Gemini Observatory to measure the speed of stars swirling in the cluster's core, E. Noyola and colleagues found that stars closer to the core are moving faster than stars farther away. This measurement was interpreted to mean that unseen matter at the core is interacting gravitationally with nearby stars. By comparing these results with standard models, the astronomers concluded that the most likely cause was the gravitational pull of a dense, massive object such as a black hole. They calculated the object's mass at 40,000 solar masses.[24]\n\nMore recent work has challenged conclusions that there is a black hole in the cluster's core, in particular disputing the proposed location of the cluster center.[26][27] Calculations using a revised location for the center found that the velocity of core stars does not vary with distance, as would be expected if an intermediate-mass black hole were present. The same studies also found that starlight does not increase toward the center but instead remains relatively constant. The authors noted that their results do not entirely rule out the black hole proposed by Noyola and colleagues, but they do not confirm it, and they limit its maximum mass to 12,000 solar masses.\n\nA study from July 10, 2024 has examined seven fast-moving stars from the center of Omega Centauri and found that their speeds were consistent with an intermediate-mass black hole of at least 8,200 solar masses.[28]\n\nIt has been speculated that Omega Centauri is the core of a dwarf galaxy that was disrupted and absorbed by the Milky Way.[29] Indeed, Kapteyn's Star, which is currently only 13 light-years away from Earth, is thought to originate from Omega Centauri.[30] Omega Centauri's chemistry and motion in the Milky Way are also consistent with this picture.[20] Like Mayall II, Omega Centauri has a range of metallicities and stellar ages that suggests that it did not all form at once (as globular clusters are thought to form) and may in fact be the remainder of the core of a smaller galaxy long since incorporated into the Milky Way.[31]\n\nThe novel Singularity (2012), by Ian Douglas, presents as fact that Omega Centauri and Kapteyn's Star originate from a disrupted dwarf galaxy, and this origin is central to the novel's plot. A number of scientific aspects of Omega Centauri are discussed as the story progresses, including the likely radiation environment inside the cluster and what the sky might look like from inside the cluster.[32]\n\nThe character Atlan has adventures in Omega Centauri in cycle 7 of the Atlan series, a spinoff of the German science fiction series Perry Rhodan.

A response team reviewed Terra’s status, and discussed potential impacts and options. Consequently, the team changed the battery charge rate and reduced spacecraft power demands by placing the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument into Safe Mode. As a result, ASTER data are not currently being collected. All other instruments continue uninterrupted. The engineering team will continue to closely monitor Terra’s power output and provide future updates on ASTER’s status.\n\nTerra explores the connections between Earth’s atmosphere, land, snow and ice, ocean, and energy balance to understand Earth’s climate and climate change and to map the impact of human activity and natural disasters on communities and ecosystems\n\nExamples of each instrument’s capabilities (clockwise): land composition (ASTER), reflected energy (CERES), aerosols (MISR), vegetation snow and ice (MODIS), carbon monoxide (MOPITT)\n\nDirect Broadcast Update (November 2024): \n\nTerra has not been transmitting Direct Broadcast since May 11, 2024, due to a solar array power generation issue limiting our ability to continue all science and provide Direct Broadcast continuously.

But, at the same time that our lives on Earth were being shaped by our access to technology, 705 kilometers above us, a satellite was changing how we understood our planet.\n\nFor 20 years, Terra, the flagship Earth observing satellite,\n\nhas chronicled changes on Earth. Designed and built in the 1980s and 90s, NASA and Lockheed Martin engineers set out to build a satellite that could take simultaneous measurements of Earth’s atmosphere, land, and water. Its mission – to understand how Earth is changing and to identify the consequences for life on Earth. Season after season, Terra data continues to help\n\nus understand how the evolving systems of our planet affect our lives – and how\n\nwe can use that data to benefit society.

C.) fue una matemática y filósofa griega,[1]​ miembro de la escuela pitagórica.\n\nFue hija del atleta Milón de Crotona, mecenas del filósofo y matemático Pitágoras,[2]​ con quien luego se casó.[3]​[4]​[5]​[1]​ Se le atribuye haber escrito tratados de matemáticas, física y medicina, y también sobre la proporción áurea. Se conservan fragmentos de sus cartas. La mayor parte de los textos que nos han llegado de mujeres de esta época, quizá por ser los que resultaban más interesantes a los religiosos que los han conservado, hablan de problemas morales o prácticos. A Téano se le atribuye un tratado Sobre la piedad del que se conserva un fragmento con una disquisición sobre el número. Además se le atribuyen los tratados sobre los poliedros rectangulares y sobre la teoría de la proporción, en particular sobre la proporción áurea.[6]​\n\nLa escuela pitagórica estaba formada por los seguidores de Pitágoras (572-497 a. C.). En la influyente escuela pitagórica, las Matemáticas se estudiaban con pasión. Se afirmaba \"todo es número\", ya que se creía que en la naturaleza todo podía explicarse mediante los números. Daban mucha importancia a la educación tanto de hombres como de mujeres, que no se limitaban a las artes útiles, sino que también se ocupaban del lenguaje y del rigor del razonamiento. Consideraban importante que una mujer fuera inteligente y culta.\n\nLa figura de Téano ha atraído la atención de los estudiosos, sobre todo de los trabajos feministas modernos, ya desde Gilles Ménage y su Historia Mulierum philosopharum, que compone precisamente con la intención de manifestar que también hubo mujeres filósofas en la antigüedad griega. Sea como sea, lo cierto es que la figura de Téano está construida, como tantas otras, con las técnicas habituales de los biógrafos antiguos, más atentos a la narración anecdótica y significativa que a la investigación rigurosa.[7]​\n\nTéano fue una matemática que consideraba que todo lo material era medible con los números naturales, por lo tanto todo se podía expresar con una medida exacta.[8]​\n\nLa tradición antigua nos da noticias de la existencia de Téano, considerada como la primera mujer filósofa, si bien su celebridad se atribuye a su vínculo matrimonial con Pitágoras.[9]​ Pero buena parte de su trabajo no era en realidad suyo: se firmaba a su nombre lo que publicaban los miembros de su escuela (algo muy habitual en el mundo antiguo), entre los que estaba Téano. Cuando Pitágoras murió, en una revuelta de los ciudadanos de Crotona contra su grupo, que se hizo con el control de la ciudad, Téano y varias hijas suyas se llevaron consigo los papeles del matemático, ampliando su trabajo. Viajaron por Grecia y Egipto, investigando no sólo en matemáticas, sino en medicina y otras ciencias. Sin sus aportaciones y las de sus hijas, es probable que Pitágoras hubiese quedado en el olvido.[10]​\n\nComo las demás pitagóricas, Téano pensaba que el Universo estaba regido por el número: la búsqueda de la perfección y la armonía en formas y proporciones le llevó a trabajar en el número áureo, el cual aparece frecuentemente en la naturaleza y fue el primer número irracional que conocieron los griegos. Este número lo conoció Téano por ser el resultado de dividir la longitud de la diagonal entre la longitud del lado del pentágono que aparece en el signo de la escuela pitagórica, el pentagrama.[11]​\n• Valdés, J. N., Nadal, A. O., Lorenzo, E. R., & Casanova, M. S. Barcelona, 2016. Muchos siglos antes de Hipatia ya hubo mujeres matemáticas. Sociedad Española de Estudios Clásicos.\n• Grau Guijarro, Sergi. Téano de Crotona i Pitàgoras de Samos: matrimoni pitagòric o invenció biogràfica? 2016\n• Sobre Téano y fragmentos de sus textos en el sitio de la Bibliotheca Augustana (Augsburgo); en griego.Teano de Crotona, filósofa: Las filósofas más antiguas que conocemos provienen del entorno de Pitágoras de Samos. Teano de Crotona es la pitagórica más famosa (a partir del 550 a. C). Nació en Crotona en el sur de Italia, donde Pitágoras había creado una escuela filosófica.\n\nDe esta filósofa sólo se conserva un fragmento del tratado Sobre la piedad. Pero parece que escribió diversos tratados de filosofía, matemáticas y medicina. Se le atribuye, entre otras cosas, el teorema matemático de la “proporción áurea”. Se conoce así la división de un segmento a través de un punto, de manera que la parte mayor es al todo como la parte menor a la mayor.\n\nIgual que Pitágoras, Teano era partidaria de una forma de vida que tiene como lema la medida y la prudencia. La finalidad de su filosofía es entender mejor el alma, que es inmortal y se reencarna después de la muerte. El cuerpo es una prisión del alma. El ser humano forma parte del mundo, que también tiene alma y origen divino. Jamás encontraremos la materia separada. Todo está relacionado con todo; no hay nada aislado. El mundo y el ser humano viven por naturaleza en armonía y deberíamos tener cuidado de no perturbar esta armonía. Se requiere ascesis y trabajo espiritual. Se atribuye un efecto positivo sobre todo a las matemáticas y a la música, ya que el número cuenta con un papel importante en estas dos disciplinas.\n\nPara Teano, la filosofía estaba muy ligada a la práctica; evoluciona sin alejarse mucho de la normalidad de la vida diaria. Reflexionar sobre el sentido de la vida implica también preguntarse cómo dar sentido a la vida de cada día. No hay una separación entre teoría y práctica.\n\nVeamos unas palabras de Teano de Crotona, de su obra Sobre la piedad:\n\n“Según he oído decir, muchos griegos piensan que Pitágoras afirma que todo ha sido engendrado por el número. Pero esta afirmación contiene una dificultad: ¿cómo podemos imaginar cosas que no son existentes y que pueden engendrar? Y es que Pitágoras no dijo que todas las cosas nacían del número, ya que en el número reside el orden esencial, y si dividimos el orden en primero, segundo y así sucesivamente, las cosas, que son contables, participan de este orden.”\n\nEn este texto tan breve ya puede apreciarse la complejidad del pensamiento de Teano. Igual que para Pitágoras, las matemáticas tienen para ella un papel importante.Teano (filosofa) - Wikipedia: Teano (in greco antico: Θεανώ?, Theanṓ; Crotone, VI secolo a.C.[1] – ...) è stata una filosofa greca antica che sarebbe stata, secondo alcune fonti, figlia o moglie di Pitagora, discepola della sua scuola[2] dove apprendevano la dottrina del maestro altre 28 allieve[3]. Secondo altre fonti[4] ella sarebbe stata invece la figlia di Brontino, successore di Pitagora. Dal matrimonio con il maestro sarebbero nati tre figli: due maschi, Telauge e Arimnesto, e una femmina, Damo. Dopo la morte del marito sposò Aristeo.\n\nSecondo la Suda, Didimo e Clemente Alessandrino, Teano nacque a Crotone[5].\n\nCi sono pervenute sette sue lettere, tre delle quali considerate autentiche.

Entre los tipos principales de fútbol se incluyen el fútbol de asociación, el fútbol americano, el fútbol canadiense, el fútbol australiano, el fútbol gaélico y también, en algunos contextos, el rugby league y el rugby union.\n\nSe estima que hay 250 millones de futbolistas en el mundo,[1]​ y muchos de ellos practican otras variantes del fútbol.\n\nJean-Pierre Papin describió el fútbol como un \"lenguaje universal\". [2]​ Los futbolistas de todo el mundo y de casi cualquier nivel pueden atraer regularmente a grandes multitudes de espectadores, y los jugadores son los puntos focales de fenómenos sociales generalizados como la cultura del fútbol asociativo .\n\nLos futbolistas generalmente comienzan como aficionados, y los mejores jugadores progresan hasta convertirse en jugadores profesionales. Normalmente inician en un equipo juvenil, que puede ser cualquier equipo local, y a partir de ahí, según sus habilidades y talento, los ojeadores les ofrecen contratos. Una vez fichados, algunos mejoran sus habilidades en el juego, y unos pocos avanzan a los equipos senior o profesionales.\n\nLos salarios en algunas ligas importantes son significativamente más altos que en otros trabajos. Los jugadores de la Premier League ganan un promedio de alrededor de 1 millón de dólares al año.[3]​ En los clubes más ricos de las ligas de fútbol europeas, algunos jugadores tienen un salario promedio que oscila entre 6 y 8 millones de dólares al año.[4]​ Los mejores jugadores de esos clubes pueden llegar a ganar hasta 220 millones de dólares al año.[5]​[6]​\n\nSin embargo, solo una fracción de los futbolistas profesionales masculinos recibe un salario de este nivel. Los salarios pueden ser mucho más moderados en otras divisiones y ligas, y un número significativo de los jugadores son semiprofesionales. Por ejemplo, el salario medio anual de los futbolistas de la Major League Soccer para la temporada 2013 fue de 148.693 dólares, con variaciones significativas según la posición del jugador (los porteros, por ejemplo, ganaron 85.296 dólares, mientras que los delanteros ganaron 251.805 dólares).[6]​[7]​\n\nLa popularidad y los salarios medios en las ligas femeninas son mucho más bajos. Por ejemplo, las jugadoras de la Liga Nacional de Fútbol Femenino (NWSL) (que comenzó en 2012) ganan entre 15.000 y 40.000 dólares al año en enero de 2017. [8]​\n\nUna minoría de futbolistas retirados continúa trabajando a tiempo completo en el fútbol, por ejemplo, como entrenadores. Un estudio de 1979 informó que los exjugadores del primer equipo estaban sobrerrepresentados como ejecutivos de alto rango en sus empresas y tenían mayor movilidad de ingresos que los jugadores del segundo equipo y los reservas.[9]​ Sin embargo, algunos experimentan problemas de salud crónicos.\n\nEn el fútbol asociativo, existen cuatro tipos tradicionales de posiciones: guardametas, defensores (laterales), mediocampistas (medios) y delanteros (atacantes). Las posiciones de propósito especial son líberos, pivotes defensivos, mediapuntas, extremos, interiores, etc.\n• Guardametas: gran altura, buenos reflejos, comunicación con la defensa, habilidad en el uno contra uno, dominio del área e inteligencia aérea. 10 ​\n• Defensas centrales: buena capacidad de cabeceo y entrada, altura, valentía en el intento y concentración. 11 ​\n• Laterales: ritmo, resistencia, anticipación, capacidad de entrada y marcación, ritmo de trabajo y responsabilidad del equipo. 12 ​\n• Mediocampistas: resistencia, capacidad de pase, responsabilidad del equipo, posicionamiento, capacidad de marcar. 13 ​\n• Extremos: ritmo, habilidad técnica como regate y control cercano, inteligencia sin balón, creatividad. 14 ​\n• Delanteros: habilidad para rematar, compostura, habilidad técnica, habilidad para cabecear, ritmo, inteligencia sin balón, rapidez. 15 ​\n\nLas posiciones en los equipos de fútbol americano están categorizadas por una forma de juego en la que cada una tiene su espectro de posiciones. Se dividen en equipos ofensivos, defensivos y especiales.\n\nLas investigaciones indican que los jugadores de fútbol americano que ejecutan un tiro penal en menos de 200 milisegundos después de que el árbitro hace sonar el silbato tienen significativamente menos probabilidades de anotar en comparación con aquellos que esperan más de un segundo.[16]​ [17]​\n\nUn estudio irlandés de 2002 sobre jugadores de fútbol gaélicos y de asociaciones caracterizó a los jugadores como \"delgados y musculosos con un nivel razonablemente alto de capacidad en todas las áreas del rendimiento físico\".[18]​ En contraste, en el fútbol americano, la obesidad puede ser causa de graves problemas de salud.[19]​\n\nUn estudio del año 2000 documentó las lesiones sufridas por futbolistas checos en todos los niveles:[20]​\n\n[21]​ La tendinitis rotuliana (dolor de rodilla) se considera una lesión que proviene de un sobreesfuerzo, y afecta a otros deportistas de prácticamente todos los deportes. Es un problema común entre los jugadores de fútbol y generalmente puede tratarse mediante un programa de fortalecimiento del cuádriceps. Las actividades de salto ejercen una tensión especialmente intensa sobre el tendón, y con saltos repetitivos, pueden producirse desgarros y lesiones en el tendón. La lesión crónica y la respuesta de curación resultan en inflamación y dolor localizado.[22]​\n\nAunque los niveles de depresión y dolor en los jugadores de fútbol retirados están a la par con el promedio social, [23]​ algunos jugadores sufren lesiones crónicas posteriores a la jubilación. Las lesiones en la cabeza son una preocupación particular.\n\nLos estudios han demostrado durante mucho tiempo que los exjugadores de fútbol americano de la NFL tienen una esperanza de vida más larga que el público en general o los hombres con una distribución racial y de edad similar, pero una tasa más alta de problemas cardiovasculares. [24]​ Un estudio que comparó las muertes de exjugadores de las Grandes Ligas de Béisbol encontró que los jugadores de béisbol vivían aún más, lo que quizás sugiere un sesgo de \"trabajador sano\" donde los atletas de la NFL vivieron menos tiempo de lo que habrían vivido de otra manera, a pesar de su esperanza de vida más larga que el promedio. [25]​ Una revisión de la evidencia realizada en 2009 en el American Journal of Medicine concluyó que la evidencia existente \"no sugiere un aumento de la mortalidad\", pero sí \"sugiere un mayor riesgo cardiovascular, particularmente en los linieros más pesados\". [26]​\n\nEn el fútbol asociativo, un estudio alemán de 2011 encontró que los jugadores de la selección alemana vivían 1,9 años menos que la población masculina general. [27]​\n\nUn estudio de 1983 sobre jugadores de rugby encontró que la esperanza de vida de los All Blacks era la misma que la de la población general. [28]​\n\nLos futbolistas australianos tienen tasas de mortalidad más bajas que la población general. [29]​\n\nLos jugadores de fútbol americano son propensos a sufrir lesiones en la cabeza, como conmociones cerebrales . En la vejez, esto aumenta el riesgo de demencia [30]​ y Alzheimer . [31]​ Los jugadores profesionales de fútbol americano que reportan conmociones cerebrales tienen un mayor riesgo de tener episodios depresivos más adelante en la vida en comparación con los jugadores retirados que reportan no tener conmociones cerebrales. [32]​ [33]​\n\nProbablemente debido al trauma repetido asociado con los cabeceos, se ha sugerido que el fútbol de asociación profesional aumenta la incidencia de esclerosis lateral amiotrófica . [34]​ En un estudio de 1987 sobre exjugadores de la selección nacional de fútbol de la asociación noruega, se encontró que un tercio de los jugadores padecía atrofia cerebral central, es decir, daño cerebral. Un estudio de 1999 relacionó el fútbol con una lesión traumática en la cabeza crónica (CTHI): [35]​\n\nLos ligamentos cruzados anteriores son particularmente vulnerables en la mayoría de los tipos de fútbol debido a las lesiones que pueden sufrir durante las entradas .\n\nSe ha encontrado una mayor incidencia de osteoartritis en la articulación de la cadera en jugadores de fútbol retirados. [36]​\n\nUn estudio de 2012 sobre lesiones en asociaciones de fútbol encontró que el 19% de todas las lesiones eran lesiones musculares, de las cuales el 54% afectaba a los músculos del muslo. [37]​\n\nEn un estudio de 2009, se descubrió que el fútbol asociado se asocia con patrones de sueño y funcionamiento psicológico favorables en jugadores de fútbol adolescentes. [38]​\n\nSe ha descubierto que la tasa de suicidio entre los veteranos de la NFL es un 59% menor que en la población general.\n\nEn 2012, la FIFA publicó un documento destinado a identificar factores de riesgo clave para los jugadores de fútbol. [39]​\n\nEn 2015, una revisión sistemática de una muestra de cincuenta y cuatro publicaciones revisadas por pares y tres artículos sobre la mortalidad y la longevidad de los atletas de élite dio como resultado importantes resultados de longevidad para los atletas de élite (béisbol, fútbol americano, fútbol, baloncesto y ciclismo). en comparación con controles de la población general y otros atletas de la misma edad y sexo\". La longevidad estuvo influenciada por factores como el tipo de deporte, la posición de juego, la carrera y el sistema energético. [40]​\n\nUn estudio observacional realizado con futbolistas profesionales -en activo (durante su carrera) y recientemente retirados (después de su carrera, con más de 45 años)- en 70 países entre 2007 y 2013, elaborado a partir de datos de la Unión Mundial de Futbolistas (FIFPro), registró 214 muertes de las cuales el 25% fue causada por accidentes, el 11% por suicidios y el 33% por sospecha de patología cardíaca (sobre un total del 55% de las muertes causadas por algún tipo de enfermedad). [41]​\n\nSe requieren evaluaciones clínicas, ECG y ecocardiografías de los atletas como herramientas previas a la participación para prevenir muertes cardíacas súbitas en personas menores de 35 años. Para evaluar el riesgo de fibrosis miocárdica, se puede utilizar y recomendar el uso adicional de realce tardío con gadolinio (LGE) con imágenes pre y poscontraste y de fracción de volumen extracelular (ECV). [42]​ Incluso alentado, todavía no se hizo obligatorio.\n\nEn 2015 se analizaron 205 muertes entre deportistas profesionales norteamericanos que estaban registrados como activos en el momento de su fallecimiento. Se recopilaron datos para los cuatro deportes principales: Asociación Nacional de Baloncesto (NBA), Liga Nacional de Fútbol Americano (NFL), Liga Nacional de Hockey (NHL) y Liga Mayor de Béisbol (MLB). Los jugadores activos de la NFL y la NBA tenían \"una mayor probabilidad de morir en un accidente automovilístico \" y una probabilidad significativamente mayor de morir de una enfermedad relacionada con el corazón en comparación con las poblaciones activas de la NHL y la MLB. [43]​\n\nEn 2013, un estudio sobre 3.439 atletas retirados de las Ligas Nacionales de Fútbol con al menos cinco temporadas acreditadas entre 1959 y 1988 no mostró una correlación estadística entre la mortalidad por suicidio y la actividad profesional, particularmente relacionada con el fútbol, en comparación con la muestra de control general. No se informó estratificación entre jugadores de posición veloces y no veloces. [44]​\n\nHasta la década de 2000 se ha publicado un número muy limitado de estudios formales sobre la mortalidad por todas las causas en jugadores de fútbol, a pesar del gran interés del público por el asunto. Un estudio ampliado realizado en Italia entre 1975 y 2003 sobre un total de 5.389 jugadores, de entre 14 y 35 años, destacó que, si bien la mortalidad por cáncer y enfermedades cardiovasculares entre la cohorte de jugadores de fútbol era significativamente menor que la de la población italiana en general, \" Las tasas de mortalidad por esclerosis lateral amiotrófica y accidentes automovilísticos fueron significativamente más altas de lo esperado, y para la ELA el riesgo es 18 veces mayor de lo esperado\".

In the Iberian Peninsula humanists often wrote in Spanish and Portuguese, adapting the literary style of Petrarch, Boccaccio, and other Italian humanists to their own local languages. Northern European humanists continued to rely on Latin, although there were notable exceptions of humanists who dedicated themselves to using and expanding their local languages. Outside Italy, humanists promoted notions about their movement similar to those already expressed in Florence and other Italian cities. They celebrated their movement as the birth of a new \"Golden Age\" in which religion and learning would be invigorated by the examples of Antiquity and a renewal in moral philosophy. In Northern Europe and Spain, humanism became associated with plans for Christian reform and placed less emphasis on the rhetoric of Cicero and other ancient writers. For this reason humanism outside Italy has sometimes been called \"Christian humanism.\" The philosophers and writers of this movement advocated a renewal of Christianity that would be illuminated by the new knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew and envisioned a reform of the church that would rely on the knowledge of Antiquity and the study of the scriptures in their original languages. They emphasized the importance of moral philosophy rather than scholastic logic, and were often just as critical of the scholastics as their Italian predecessors had been. But as in Italy, the gulf that separated humanism from scholasticism was not so deep as many humanists claimed. Some humanists, for instance, studied both scholasticism and the newer forms of learning, but their anti-scholastic rhetoric made many universities initially resistant to the humanists. By 1500, though, humanists had gained a foothold in many institutions of learning north of the Alps and in Spain and Portugal.\n\nIn both Germany and the Netherlands, the humanist movement exhibited signs that were similar to the Renaissance elsewhere in Northern Europe. Like its Italian version, humanism here owed a great debt to the classics of Greek and Roman Antiquity. Rediscovering and studying classical texts became a burning desire of humanists in Germany and the Netherlands; these scholars argued that literary study was more conducive to human virtue than the arid logical considerations of scholasticism. For these reasons, the humanists initially encountered opposition as they tried to assume positions in Dutch and German schools and universities. Eventually, these barriers were overcome, and by 1500, the humanists had gained a foothold. In the educational institutions in which they taught, the humanists argued for a reformed curriculum based upon the study of the classical languages. But as the movement developed in Germany and the Netherlands, they also advocated religious reform and an ideal of learned Christian piety. In Germany, the first great scholar of humanism was Rudolph Agricola (1444–1485). Like many later German and Dutch humanists, Agricola had been schooled by the Brethren of the Common Life, the lay monastic movement that had developed in the Netherlands and Germany from the Modern Devotion movement. When he was 25, Agricola traveled to Italy, studying the Classics at Ferrara and Pavia. After ten years he returned to Germany, where he spent the remainder of his life encouraging the development of humanistic studies from his post at the University of Heidelberg. Agricola's religious ideas were conservative and traditional, but he laid great emphasis on the study of the scriptures, something that later Dutch and German humanists embraced enthusiastically. Although he died relatively young, he had by the time of his death developed a group of disciples that included Conrad Celtis and Jakob Wimpheling, two scholars who expanded the cause of humanism in Germany. Their efforts saw humanism embraced in the imperial court, as the emperor Maximilian I appointed a number of classical scholars to serve as secretaries, historians, and astrologers in his government. One of the greatest of these was Johannes Reuchlin, who accepted several imperial appointments during the 1490s and 1500s. Reuchlin was one of the most widely traveled scholars of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. He studied at the universities of Orlèans, Basel, Paris, Tübingen, and in Rome and Florence, before devoting himself to the study of the Hebrew language and Jewish literature. He authored the first grammar of Hebrew intended for Christian students of the language, and he published several monumental studies of the Jewish Cabala. Because of these involvements, Reuchlin was eventually drawn into a controversy over the study of Jewish books (see Religion: Reuchlin Affair). Many of the imperial humanists that Germany produced in these years were advocates of German nationalism. In their historical works these court humanists tried to address a sense of cultural inferiority. They attempted to show in their works that Germans had not been barbarians (an interpretation of German history that Italian humanists had kept alive through their knowledge of Tacitus and other ancient Latin writers). The Dutch humanists did not share this focus on national identity. But like their German counterparts, they took an interest in the study of traditional mystical texts and in the newer metaphysical ideas of Renaissance Platonism.\n\n[This text has been suppressed due to author restrictions]\n\nThe Dutch-born Desiderius Erasmus (c. 1466–1536) was the commanding figure produced by the Renaissance in Northern Europe. Erasmus was a religious thinker of profound depth, a writer of some of the sixteenth century's most brilliant and cultivated prose, and a philosopher of some sophistication. Like Agricola and other German and Dutch humanists, he had been trained in youth in the traditions of the Brethren of the Common Life, and the concept of the imitation of Christ advocated by the Modern Devotion had shaped his early life. To these early interests, Erasmus added training in the methods of both humanism and scholasticism. Erasmus's writings fall into three categories. First, he produced works of critical scholarship, editing important classical works and translations, including his definitive translation of the New Testament. Second, Erasmus published a number of comic and satirical works, including his famous Colloquies. He wrote the Colloquies as a series of conversational dialogues, and teachers used them to train young men in the knowledge of Latin. The works mocked the foibles and superstitions of people, most especially of monks and scholars. Finally, a third category of Erasmus's works aimed for a re-establishment of early Christian teachings in Europe. In this last kind of work, Erasmus frequently outlined his \"Philosophy of Christ,\" a set of teachings he believed were revealed in the gospels, particularly in the Sermon on the Mount. Among the several works that Erasmus wrote in this vein, his Handbook of the Militant Christian (1503) was the most influential in attracting disciples to his ideas and plans for Christian reform. The work argued that the kernel of all Christ's teachings consisted in love, charity, and respect exercised toward one's neighbors. \"Wish for good, pray for good, act for good to all men\" is how he summarized this great rule in the Handbook. Erasmus's beautiful literary style and his engaging summation of the core of Christian teachings attracted numerous admirers throughout Europe in the sixteenth century. To many educated humanists, his works presented a middle path between the extremes of traditional Catholicism and the newer and more radical forms of Protestantism. Vestiges of his reform ideas survived in the works of many humanists, many of whom served in Christian reform efforts throughout Europe. His ideas, for instance, were particularly important in shaping the course of the Reformation's teachings in England, and had admirers at the same time in the Catholic reformers in Spain and Italy. As the sixteenth century progressed, though, and religious positions hardened on both sides of the Protestant and Catholic divides in Europe, Erasmus attracted increasing criticism from many quarters. Catholic traditionalists identified in Erasmus's emphasis on the spiritual nature of Christianity a set of teachings that was subversive to the sacraments and religious discipline. By the end of the century, a number of his works had been placed upon the Index of Prohibited Books, a list of books which Catholics were forbidden to read. For committed Protestants, too, Erasmus's denial of the concept of justification by faith and his loyalty to Rome helped limit his appeal.\n\nRenaissance humanism attracted significant support from English intellectuals at the end of the fifteenth century, despite the conservative character of intellectual life in the country at the time. Many aspects of English learning remained tied to medieval scholasticism, and chivalric ideals still dominated English elite society in the late fifteenth century. Still, during the 1460s and 1470s a group of English scholars traveled to Italy to study with humanists and several were students of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Marsilio Ficino. These included Thomas Linacre, William Sellyng, and William Grocyn. This last figure was particularly important in building a circle of humanist scholars in England. Grocyn served as court physician and a royal tutor during the time of Henry VII and Henry VIII. While he did not write a great deal, like Rudolph Agricola in Germany, he helped to popularize humanistic studies among England's intellectual elite. The first undeniably accomplished English humanist, though, was John Colet (1466–1519), who was a member of the clergy and dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Colet had spent four years in Italy during his youth, much of it in close affiliation with Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. When he returned to England, he helped to spread knowledge of Ficino and Renaissance Platonism. Like Erasmus and other Northern Renaissance humanists, he was critical of the corruption of the church and the popular superstitions of the people, and his sermons argued for a reform of ecclesiastical abuses. His great achievement, though, lay in fostering the study of the humanities in England through his foundation of St. Paul's School in London. This cathedral school opened the way for the training of members of the English elite in the classics and it exerted a significant influence on English intellectual life during the following centuries.\n\nSir Thomas More (1478–1535), an admirer of John Colet, exemplifies a different path taken by some English humanists. He was a layman and a lawyer who occupied the highest political positions in the court ofHenry VIII. More received his Bachelor of Arts at Oxford before studying law at the Inns of Court in London. By 1510, he had become an official in the City of London and he soon rose to serve in Henry VIII's diplomatic service. It was while on a diplomatic mission to Flanders that More wrote part of his famous Utopia, a work that has since his time been the model for many imaginary visions of a perfect society. The Utopia, one of the best examples of sixteenth-century literature, also reflects More's personal philosophy (see Literature: Utopia). He was skeptical of humankind's ability to achieve virtue, and the society he imagined in his work was tightly ordered and highly disciplined so that its people could avoid their natural inclinations toward wrong-doing. More was well read, and an excellent stylist in Latin prose; he was also well connected among humanists in England and in Europe. Among his correspondents, he maintained a close friendship with Erasmus throughout his life, and Erasmus dedicated his Praise of Folly to him. Religiously, though, More was more conservative than the Dutch humanist. He engaged in prayer vigils and practiced ascetic disciplines like the wearing of a hair shirt. While he enthusiastically supported charities, he was also an unswerving opponent of heresy. As a royal official, he supported the persecution of heretics, including those who were drawn to the new Protestant ideas that began to circulate in England in the 1520s. The same sword of royal authority that More wielded to eradicate Protestants in England would eventually be turned against him. Because of his loyalty to the Roman Church, he refused to recognize Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and he was condemned and beheaded in 1535.\n\nIn France, humanism developed within the same time frame as it did in Germany, the Netherlands, and England. While the country's intellectual centers, particularly the University of Paris, were resistant to the new studies, humanists had established themselves at Lyon and Paris by the late fifteenth century. Both towns were important printing centers, and they played a key role in spreading the new humanistic knowledge throughout Europe. Robert Gaguin (1433–1501) was the first in a distinguished lineage of French humanists. In his works he tried to harmonize classical philosophy with Christian teaching, a goal that would be pursued by a number of French Renaissance thinkers. Gaguin's influence upon his students at Paris helped to permanently establish the humanities within the university. His influence, though, was soon to be eclipsed by Giullaume Budé (1467–1540) and Jacques Lefèvre D'Etaples (1450–1536), the two most accomplished scholars of the French Renaissance. By training, Budé was a lawyer, and found no university appointment until he established his own college late in life. He was a particularly astute philologist, who translated the Greek works of Plutarch and wrote treatises in Greek even in his youth. Of the many honors that Budé received during his lifetime, one was to prove particularly important for posterity: his appointment as the head of the king's library enabled him to purchase a number of important Greek manuscripts. Jacques Lefèvre D'Etaples, by contrast, took a different turn in his scholarship. Inspired by the example of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Lefèvre became convinced of the unity of philosophical truth. As a result he ranged broadly in his studies, dedicating himself to the works of Italian Renaissance Platonists, the medieval scholastics and mystics, the Jewish cabalistic writers, and hermeticism. As he matured, though, he concentrated his efforts on biblical scholarship, and in his studies of the New Testament he developed ideas that were similar to many German Protestants. Lefèvre remained a devout Catholic, but as a consequence, his scriptural studies shaped the ideas of some of France's early Protestant reformers.\n\nHumanist influences can be seen in both Spain and Portugal from the early fifteenth century as the works of Petrarch and Boccacio became popular in the peninsula. In both countries, as elsewhere in Europe, the demand for properly trained secretaries and diplomats helped to fuel the popularity of humanism. The presence of an increasing number of skilled Latinists within the region in the fifteenth century encouraged the study of classical texts, as well as the importation of works by the Italian humanists and their translation into Spanish and Portuguese. During the reign of the married monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, humanist study within the two kingdoms of Castile and Aragon expanded. The project for a new polyglot Bible at Alcala, which became known as the Complutensian Polyglot, brought many humanists to Spain in the early sixteenth century. But it was not until the reign of the Spanish emperor Charles V (r. 1516–1556) that a true Renaissance in Spanish learning occurred. During the early part of Charles' reign Spain's humanists revered the works of Erasmus, including the Handbook of the Militant Christian, which for a time became the country's most widely read devotional book. Its influence persisted even after its placement on the Index in 1559. In Charles' Spain, a number of distinguished humanists were actively engaged in the king's service. These included Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Juan de Valdés, and Antonio de Guevara. The greatest of Spain's humanists, Juan Luis Vives, was also from a family of recent converts to Christianity. Known as conversos, these former Jews or descendants of Jews were particularly receptive to the ideas of Erasmian humanism. Vives studied in Spain until his teenage years, when he moved to the University of Paris. When still young, he distinguished himself through the publication of his The Fable of Man, a work tinged with Renaissance Platonism. As a result of his literary successes, Vives became a professor of literature at the University of Louvain, and eventually served as the royal tutor in the court of Henry VIII. When he failed to endorse Henry's divorce of Catherine of Aragon, he was forced to emigrate, and he settled in Bruges in Flanders where he spent the remainder of his life. Vives' death came before a great change in attitude toward humanism began to sweep across his native Spain. At home, fears of Protestantism gave rise after mid-century to attempts to suppress the Erasmian humanism that had circulated in Spain relatively freely during the first half of the century. Humanists came to be suspected of heresy, and followers of Erasmus, together with Spanish mystics (known as the Alumbrados) became victims of persecution. In Portugal, the rise of counter-reforming sentiments similarly discouraged a nascent humanist culture.\n\nC. G.

Tucidide e Machiavelli (Somiglianze – Differenze). Di Apostolos Apostolou: Tucidide: C’era di nome una democrazia ma di fatto un governo del cittadino migliore..\n\n Machiavelli: Tutti gli stati, tutti i domini che hanno avuto e hanno imperio sopra gli uomini, sono stati e sono o repubbliche o principati.\n\nTucidide.\n\n Di solito il realismo politico si caratterizza per il principio di privilegiare l’interesse e la sicurezza nazionale rispetto ad ideologie e problematiche morali e sociali. Tucidide vede il realismo politico con un senso più ampio, cioè come realtà storica attraverso un approccio empirico. Ma anche come l’esperienza del contatto che include le esperienze di posizione, di equilibrio e di supporto.\n\nIl realismo politico secondo Tucidide è il comune (koinon B35). La democrazia è il regime esplicitamente fondato sull’opinione, sul confronto tra le opinioni, sulla formazione di un’opinione comune. La confutazione delle opinioni altrui è ben più che permessa e legittima, essa è addirittura l’ossigeno della vita pubblica (Peri homonoias H 93).\n\nLa vita è esperienza, cioè improvvisazione, utilizzazione delle occasioni, tentativi in tutte le direzioni. E il cittadino ha dignità solo quando può scegliere il suo modo d’essere. Perciò il termine polis indica l’ipotetico patto fondato sul reciproco interesse dei politai (cioè cittadini) della città. (Γ 82). Perché come dirà il poeta K. Kavafis: “…. Ti verrà dietro la città. Per le vie girerai: le stesse. E negli stessi quartieri invecchierai, ti farai bianco nelle stesse mura. Perenne approdo, questa città….”\n\nCon altre parole secondo Tucidide il rapporto tra polis e polites (cittadini) non è lo stesso con quello di civis-civitas. Perché nella democrazia ateniese, il potere è nelle mani del popolo: nei tribunali tutti i cittadini sono eguali, e nell’esercito (i cittadini sono anche oplite, cioè soldati) delle cariche la capacità e il merito hanno annullato ogni differenza tra ricchi e poveri. La philotimia (Tucidide III, 82,8) è la virtù dei cittadini. (Nietzsche nella philotimia di Tucidide cerca il concetto dell’uomo superiore.) Euripide ha disegnato nei suoi versi un ritratto lusinghiero della polis democratica, dove regnano libertà e uguaglianza, amicizia e unione.\n\nLibertà, amicizia, eguaglianza è la concordia. Questa ultima è l’unità del sentire e del pensare (homonoia) raggiunta dai cittadini nella determinazione dei fini comuni e delle scelte necessarie per conseguirli. Se non c’è frattura tra l’individuo e la comunità, tra la sua vita privata e quella pubblica, la connessione è una dialettica della pluralità del diverso su cui la dialettica non avrebbe più alcun potere (Tucidide H 97. Sygrasis – Mescolanza. O come dice Aristotele ex anomoion he polis, Politica 3,1277° 5-6, cioè, la città è ineguale).\n\nPoiché nella città secondo Tucidide esiste sempre l’antinomia, discorso doppio (Dissoi logoi, cioè discorsi doppi) e l’idea della mutua paura (antipalon deos) necessaria al mantenimento dell’equilibrio. Così la mutua paura (antipalon deos) diventa (isopalo sevas) bilanciato rispetto.\n\nNella guerra civile esiste la techne politiche, (Protagora 322 b-c) cioè la formazione del cittadino e dei dirigenti, il compito di un processo indicativo che riguarda almeno in teoria, tutti gli uomini. E con questa techne politiche, si può risalire ad una concezione del rapporto di individuo e comunità, di cittadino e stato.\n\nAnche questa è la concezione che Platone in un passo delle Leggi riproduce dicendo che un’educazione rettamente intesa è quella che sa far nascere negli animi fin degli anni dell’infanzia, il desiderio di diventare un perfetto cittadino, capace ad un tempo di obbedire e di comandare secondo giustizia.\n\nSocrate accetta il giudizio del tribunale formato dai propri concittadini. Possiamo vedere nel Critone il suo discorso, scambiato tanto spesso per un’arringa moralistica, e uno sviluppo magnifico della fondamentale idea greca della formazione dell’individuo attraverso la propria città. Simodide scriveva: polis andra didaskei, cioè la città educa l’uomo.\n\nQui posiamo vedere anche la differenza tra Tucidide e Machiavelli. Il realismo politico di Machiavelli è il successo. E il successo per un principe nuovo si misura dalla sua capacità di conservare lo stato.\n\nL’introduzione del criterio del successo come unico metro di giudizio politico permette al Machiavelli di distinguere anche all’interno della categoria del tiranno. Il tiranno Agatocle e il tiranno Liverotto da Fermo sono i modelli di realismo politico secondo Machiavelli. Agatocle, e Liverotto da Fermo avevano conquistato lo stato con delitti e efferati. (Principe, cap. XVIII).\n\nTucidide si differenzia anche dalla dottrina spinoziana dello Stato, esposta nel Trattato politico e nel Trattato teologico- politico. Però quello di Spinoza è un realismo politico condensato sul principio della tolleranza (che significa aggiustamenti e riforme senza rivolgimenti rivoluzionari) e sul dogma come diceva Caillois Roland che sostiene: “il sistema rimane l’uomo muore”.\n\nIl realismo politico di Tucidide non esprime una speranza, perché secondo Tucidide la speranza è una condizione umana molto complessa e articolata fatta di pieni e vuoti, di esplosioni e di ripiegamenti e non è mai un sentire identico (Tucidide E 84-116). Anche l’idea di “ necessità”, considera in maniera troppo compatta situazioni che, invece sono molto differenziate (A,22,1-2). Possiamo dunque dire che il realismo politico di Tucidide diventa una riforma della politica per mezzo della molteplicità delle esperienze vitali.\n\nAlla natura del governo, che è ravvisabile nell’uso platonico e tucididico, sembrano propri alcuni elementi. Innanzitutto quello della pluralità delle parti che costituiscono un insieme, sia questo l’anima, l’ambito della casa, o quello della polis. Innanzitutto quello della pluralità delle parti che costituiscono un insieme, sia questo l’anima, l’ambito della casa, o quello della polis.\n\nTucidide era sostenitore di Teramene. Tucidide Libro H). Teramene fu uno dei fautori del colpo di Stato oligarchico ateniese del 411 a.C., che portò al governo la Boulé dei Quattrocento. Successivamente si oppose a tale regime, sostituendolo con l’assemblea dei Cinquemila che, dopo aver eliminato i principali esponenti dei Quattrocento, nel 409 restaurò pienamente la democrazia. Tucidide scrive: ἐγίγνετό τε λόγῳ µὲν δηµοκρατία, ἔργῳ δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ πρώτου ἀνδρὸς ἀρχή («C’era di nome una democrazia, ma di fatto un governo del cittadino migliore» II,65,9)\n\nMachiavelli.\n\n “Tutti gli stati, tutti i domini che hanno avuto e hanno imperio sopra li uomini, sono stati e sono o repubbliche o principati.” Con queste parole apre il Principe di Machiavelli (1469-1527). Ai principati nuovi, è dedicato la maggior parte del libro “Discorsi” di Machiavelli. Distingue quattro specie secondo il diverso modo con cui il potere viene conquistato: I) per virtù; II) per fortuna; III) per scelera , con la violenza; IV) col consenso dei cittadini. Queste quattro specie si dispongono in coppie antitetiche; virtù – fortuna, forza – consenso.\n\nMachiavelli è considerato il primo grande teorico della politica moderna e dello Stato uscito dal medioevo. La virtù politica comprende anche l’astuzia e l’uso della violenza, purché essa sia “ben usata” per costituire o difendere uno Stato ben ordinato. Il principe deve agire da “ volpe e leone”, cioè deve essere astuto e deciso, ingannatore e violento.\n\nMachiavelli sostiene che per salvare lo Stato il principe deve essere disposto anche a “operare contro la fede, la carità, l’umanità e la religione”, poiché se riuscirà, con tali mezzi, a conseguire quell’obiettivo, allora tutti lo loderanno e lo considereranno “virtuoso”.\n\nNel capitolo XV del Principe troviamo, la prospettiva machiavelliana: “Essendo l’intento mio scrivere cosa utile a chi la intende, mi è parso più conveniente andare drieto alla verità effettuale della cosa, che all’immaginazione di essa. E molti si sono immaginati repubbliche e principati che non si sono mai visti né conosciuti essere in vero; perché elli è tanto discosto da come si vive a come si doverrebbe vivere, che colui che lascia quello che si fa per quello che si doverrebbe fare, impara più tosto la ruina che la perservazione sua: perché uno uomo che voglia fare in tutte le parte professione di buono, conviene rovini infra tanti che non sono buoni. Onde è necessario a uno principe, volendosi mantenere, imparare a potere essere non buono, et usarlo e non usare secondo la necessità. Lasciando adunque indrieto le cose circa uno principe immaginate, e discorrendo quelle che sono vere, dico che tutti li uomini, quando se ne parla, e massime e principi, per essere posti più alti, sono notati di alcune di queste qualità che arrecano loro o biasimo o laude “.\n\n \n\n Cioè i concetti di virtù e di fortuna sono come è noto, centrali nella concezione machiavellica della storia.\n\nLa virtù secondo Machiavelli è la capacità personale di dominare gli eventi e di realizzare, anche ricorrendo a qualsiasi mezzo, il fine proposto; per fortuna, intende il corso degli eventi che non dipendono dalla volontà umana. Oggi cerchiamo il momento per esempio soggettivo, il momento oggettivo, o il momento storico. Secondo Machiavelli ciò che uno consegue non dipende né tutto dalla virtù, né tutto dalla fortuna, non tutto dal merito personale, non tutto dal favore delle circostanze, ma dall’una e dall’altra in parti uguali.\n\nScrive per esempio (cap.XXV) “ Nondimanco perché il nostro libero arbitrio non sia spento, iudico potere essere vero che la fortuna sia arbitra della metà delle azioni nostre, ma che atiam lei ne lasci governare l’ altra metà, o presso a noi.”\n\nCon Machiavelli l’Italia ha conosciuto il più grande teorico della politica e ha influenzato tutto il pensiero politico occidentale, e come leggiamo in Wikipedia . «Secondo Machiavelli la politica è il campo nel quale l’uomo può mostrare nel modo più evidente la propria capacità d’iniziativa, il proprio ardimento, la capacità di costruire il proprio destino secondo il classico modello del faber fortunae suae.Nel suo pensiero si risolve il conflitto fra regole morali e ragion di Stato che impone talvolta di sacrificare i propri princìpi in nome del superiore interesse di un popolo.»\n\nMolti hanno scritto che il Principe di Machiavelli era una specie di manuale delle nefandezze della tirannide celebre, mentre altri che la politica si presenta come puro calcolo di interessi, e la politica è un prodotto della immortalità, le passioni gli interessi sono il luogo, la sostanza della politica.

It is Real Madrid's reserve team. They play their home games at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium with a capacity of 6,000 seats.[2]\n\nReserve teams in Spain play in the same league system as their senior team rather than a separate league. Reserve teams, however, cannot play in the same division as their senior team. Therefore, Real Madrid Castilla are ineligible for promotion to the La Liga as long as Real Madrid plays there. Consequently, they must play at least one level below their main side and they are not eligible to play in the Copa del Rey. In addition, only under-23 players, or under-25 players with a professional contract, can switch between senior and reserve teams.\n\nIn 1948, Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, a local amateur team, then playing in the Tercera División, agreed to become a feeder club for Real Madrid. Originally formed in 1930, the team took its name from the national motto of Spain. Real gave AD Plus Ultra financial support and in return were given first refusal on the club's best players. By 1949, they made their debut in the Segunda División and in 1952, the club became the official Real reserve team. In 1959, they reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Generalísimo, losing 7–2 on aggregate to eventual runners-up Granada.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, future senior Real Madrid players and Spanish internationals such as José María Zárraga, Enrique Mateos, Ramón Marsal, Pedro Casado, Juan Manuel Villa, José María Vidal, Fernando Serena and Ramón Grosso all spent time at the club, and Juan Alonso finished off his career there. The singer Julio Iglesias played as a goalkeeper for the club in the early 1960s until injury ended his football career.[3] Miguel Muñoz began his coaching career at the club. In 1972, Plus Ultra folded because of the demise of the insurance company of the same name, and their position in the Tercera División was taken by Castilla Club de Fútbol, the new reserve team for Real Madrid, on 21 July.\n\nAs Castilla CF, the team enjoyed something of a golden age. During this era, with a team that included Agustín, Ricardo Gallego and Francisco Pineda, Castilla reached the final of the 1979–80 Copa del Rey. During their cup run, they beat four Primera División teams, including Hércules, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Sporting de Gijón.[4] The latter two eventually finished second and third in the Primera División. In the final, they played Real Madrid but lost 6–1. Because Real also won the Primera División, however, Castilla qualified for the 1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup. Despite beating West Ham United 3–1 in the opening game at the Santiago Bernabéu, they lost the return 5–1 after extra time and went out in the first round.[4] Castilla reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey on three further occasions, in 1984, 1986, and 1988.\n\nIn 1984, with Amancio Amaro as coach, Castilla won the Segunda División. Amaro's tenure as coach saw the rise of the famous La Quinta del Buitre – Emilio Butragueño, Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel, and Miguel Pardeza. Castilla were ineligible for promotion, however, because Real Madrid were already in the Primera División. In the 1987–88 season, they finished third in the Segunda División, but were once again ineligible for promotion.\n\nIn 1991, the Royal Spanish Football Federation banned the use of separate names for reserve teams and Castilla CF became known as Real Madrid Deportiva and then Real Madrid B. In the early 1990s, two former Castilla players, Vicente del Bosque and Rafael Benítez, began their coaching careers with the team. In 1997, the team was relegated to the Segunda División B, but despite this, they continued to produce internationally acclaimed players. These have included Raúl, Guti and Iker Casillas, who all became established members of the senior Real Madrid team.\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, coach Juan Ramón López Caro guided the team back to the Segunda División and the team subsequently revived the El Castilla name and became known as Real Madrid Castilla. In 2006, the new stadium of the club's training facilities Ciudad Real Madrid was named the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium and Francisco Moreno Cariñena became the first independent chairman in 16 years. In this year, the team also has continued to produce quality players such as Roberto Soldado and Álvaro Arbeloa.\n\nIn the 2006–2007 season, the team was relegated to the Segunda División B under the management of ex-Real Madrid legend Míchel after occupying 19th place in the league in a disappointing season. Míchel received a lot of criticism and accepted all the blame for the team's bad performances, especially for those who had a wonderful season in the 2005–06 season, such as Rubén de la Red, Esteban Granero and Javi García. The reserves produced other quality players, including Juan Mata and Álvaro Negredo.\n\nReal Madrid Castilla was promoted back to the Segunda División at the end of the 2011–12 season after beating Cádiz in the play-offs with an aggregate of score 8–1 and this year the club produced one quality player, Dani Carvajal who was sold to Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 before he returned to Real Madrid in 2013 to play in the first team.\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, three quality players Nacho, Álvaro Morata and Jesé were promoted to the first team, and then Castilla was relegated in the last matchday after being defeated by Real Murcia in the last match of the season.\n\nSince 2014 when they played in the third division, Castilla continued to produce other quality players, including Lucas Vázquez, Fernando Pacheco, Borja Mayoral, Marcos Llorente, Sergio Reguilón, Óscar Rodríguez, Achraf Hakimi and Fran García.\n\nAfter the resumption of competitions in the 2020–21 season, the team finished runner-up in their group and qualified to play in the promotion system to the new categories of Spanish football after a restructuring of the same by the RFEF for the 2021–22 season.[5] In the promotion playoffs, the team finished third, which secured their place in the Primera Federación. They also had the chance to move up to the Segunda División, but they were eliminated in the semifinals by Ibiza.[6] The team was thus one of those that premiered the new Primera Federación, being placed in Group II. In 2022–23 season, Castilla placed in Group I and finished in third place, they have chance promotion to Segunda División, but they were eliminated in the final play off by Eldense. In the 2023–24 season, still under the direction of Raúl González, they finished in tenth position.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

A diferencia de otras Ligas europeas y mundiales de fútbol, en España la regulación y normativas que afecta a los equipos filiales permiten que estos puedan actuar como clubes profesionales a todos los efectos —pudiendo competir en el mismo sistema de Liga que el resto de equipos—, en vez de jugar una Liga separada de equipos filiales. El Castilla no puede ascender a una categoría superior o igual del fútbol español a la del primer equipo, siendo esta la Primera División.[10]​\n\nPese a que históricamente siempre actuó como un club de fútbol más dentro de la Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF) —y por lo tanto con los mismos derechos que cualquier otro— en cuanto a las competiciones a disputar,[n 4]​ en el año 1991 la Federación llevó a efecto un cambio en sus estatutos que afectó directamente a dichos equipos \"B\" o filiales. Desde ese momento se impidió la participación de estos equipos en la Copa del Rey,[11]​ —circunstancia aún vigente en la actualidad—, y que ha dejado al equipo madridista como único filial de España y primero del mundo en disputar la final del torneo de Copa doméstica,[n 5]​ en la que curiosamente se enfrentó a su primer equipo, el Real Madrid C. F.\n\nEntre sus logros deportivos destaca un campeonato de la Segunda División en la temporada 1983-84,[1]​ siendo el único filial español en conseguirlo, y el mencionado subcampeonato en la Copa del Rey de 1979-80 que perdió frente a su equipo matriz por 6-1.[1]​ Este logró vino con el honor de ser el primer equipo de inferior categoría que conseguía eliminar a cuatro equipos de la Primera División,[12]​,[n 6]​ otorgándole además el derecho a disputar la Recopa de Europa de la temporada 1980-81 al estar ya clasificado el primer equipo para disputar la Copa de Europa,[n 7]​ convirtiéndose en el único equipo filial en la historia del fútbol en Europa en disputar una competición en dicho continente.[n 8]​ Es además el mejor club filial por resultados deportivos de España.[13]​\n\nEl Castilla disputa sus partidos como local en el estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano localizado en la Ciudad Real Madrid,[14]​ —complejo deportivo del club situado en Valdebebas y comúnmente denominado como Ciudad Deportiva en referencia a las antiguas instalaciones—, construido en honor al presidente de honor del club D. Alfredo Di Stéfano Laulhé con una capacidad de 6500 espectadores.[15]​\n\nPese a que el equipo filial madridista es fundado oficialmente en 1972 como un club absolutamente dependiente del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol bajo el nombre de Castilla Club de Fútbol, ya durante la temporada 1931-32 aparece un Castilla F. C. formado por jugadores del Racing de Madrid, el desaparecido Sporting de Madrid y algunos antiguos jugadores madridistas donde se fogueaba a futuras promesas hasta que finalmente desaparece en 1933. ​\n\nParalelamente, el 16 de diciembre de 1930 los empleados de la compañía de seguros Plus Ultra fundan la sociedad polideportiva Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, con una masa social de 800 personas y secciones de baloncesto, rugby o remo entre otras.[16]​ El club también actuaba y hacía las funciones de equipo filial del club madridista junto a otras entidades como el Club Deportivo Pardiñas, la Sociedad Primitiva Amistad, la Sociedad Recreativa El Cafeto, la Sociedad Stadium Foot-ball Club, el Club Patria Balompié, el Imperio Foot-ball Club o la Sociedad Deportiva Leganés, sociedades dispuestas a suministrarle jugadores al club de Chamartín a cambio de diferentes ayudas para su progresión y subsistencia en algunos casos. ​ ​ A ellos se unieron después de la Guerra Civil otros como la Agrupación Deportiva Ferroviaria, o el Club Deportivo Mediodía como equipos ayudados por los madridistas en su devenir deportivo. ​[1]​\n\nOriginalmente el Real Madrid C. F. mantenía diversos acuerdos con varios clubes madrileños que le hacían las veces de cantera, de donde nutrirse de jugadores que le resultaran interesantes para su primer equipo, recibiendo material deportivo y ayudas económicas a cambio. Uno de esos equipos era la citada Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra y que en 1946 se fusiona con el Club Deportivo Cifesa con motivo del ascenso a la Tercera División y antes del ascenso a la Segunda División en apenas dos temporadas.[19]​ Uno año después estableció finalmente un acuerdo formal con el Real Madrid C. F. por el que pasó a convertirse en su club filial a cambio de las citadas ayudas prevaleciendo por encima del resto de clubes.\n\nDisputaba sus partidos tanto en su propio estadio, el Velódromo de Ciudad Lineal, como en el Estadio de Chamartín, recinto del primer equipo madridista,[16]​ y estuvo cerca del ascenso a la Primera División en la temporada 1959-60. Del club aparecen grandes figuras como José María Zárraga, Enrique Mateos, Ramón Grosso, o Miguel Muñoz, y el club se convierte en un equipo inestable tras subir y bajar de categoría en numerosas ocasiones. Tras muchos esfuerzos para retornar a la Segunda División y tras perder varias fases de ascenso en las temporadas 1963-64, 1965-66, 1966-67, y 1967-68, entró en dificultades financieras a comienzos de los años setenta, momento en el que cedió los derechos federativos de forma oficial y permanente al club madridista en 1972, y pasar a ser un club con dependencia total de los blancos.[1]​\n\nEl 21 de julio de 1972, al finalizar la temporada 1971-72, la A. D. Plus Ultra se disuelve por los malos resultados y es entonces cuando el Real Madrid, de mano de su presidente Santiago Bernabéu, adquiere los derechos deportivos y federativos del que a partir de entonces fue de manera oficial el nuevo filial madridista bajo el nombre de Castilla Club de Fútbol, en honor de la región histórica de Castilla.[20]​\n\nAl año siguiente comenzó su andadura en la Tercera División donde se mantuvo hasta su ingreso en 1977 en la recién estrenada Segunda División \"B\" como tercera categoría del fútbol español. En ella se proclama subcampeón en el año de su estreno y así, en 1978, asciende finalmente a la Segunda División.[20]​\n\nEn la temporada 1979-80 fue subcampeón de la Copa del Rey disputando una histórica final contra el primer equipo del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. Esta hazaña no ha sido igualada nunca, poseyendo el honor de ser el único equipo filial que haya disputado una final en la historia de la Copa pese a que perdería por 6-1. En las eliminatorias, el Castilla se deshizo del Extremadura, el AD Alcorcón, el Racing de Santander y a los entonces equipos de primera división, Hércules CF (tras levantar el 4-1 de la ida con un 4-0 en Madrid), el Athletic Club (al vencer en la vuelta en San Mamés por 1-2 y el empate sin goles en la capital), y a la Real Sociedad (con un resultado global de 3-2), que ese año terminaría siendo subcampeón de liga y la ganaría los dos años siguientes. En semifinales se enfrentó al Sporting de Gijón de Quini, tras vencer por 4-1 en el partido de vuelta, remontando un 2-0 de la ida.[1]​\n\nPor tal motivo, participó en la Recopa de Europa del siguiente año donde caería en la primera ronda frente al West Ham United, venciendo en el Santiago Bernabéu por 3-1, pero cayendo derrotado por 5-1 en Londres tras una prórroga.\n\nFue el periodista Julio César Iglesias el primero en usar el apelativo, en un artículo publicado por el diario El País el 14 de noviembre de 1983 titulado «Amancio y la quinta del Buitre».[21]​[22]​ En él, Iglesias hablaba de un grupo de cinco futbolistas que por entonces destacaban en el Castilla Club de Fútbol —filial del Real Madrid C. F.—, y que esa temporada se proclamó campeón de la Segunda División de España siendo el primer y único filial de la historia en conseguirlo.\n\nEl hecho se produjo en la temporada 1983-84 bajo la dirección de Amancio Amaro tras superar en la última jornada al Athletic Club, el Bilbao Athletic de Julio Salinas y Genar Andrinua que entrenaba José Ángel Iribar. El equipo estaba formado por la mítica generación de «La Quinta de El Buitre» que iba alternando su actuación en el filial con apariciones en la primera plantilla.[1]​ La misma estuvo formada por Emilio Butragueño —líder deportivo de la generación—, Míchel González, Miguel Pardeza, Manolo Sanchís y Rafael Martín Vázquez.\n\nLa expectación por ver a los jóvenes futbolistas era tal que en ocasiones disputaba sus partidos en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. Sus partidos llevaban casi tantos espectadores como los partidos del primer equipo, como los partidos de Copa del Rey o frente al citado Bilbao Athletic con quien mantenía una gran rivalidad y disputa, y que llegaban a reunir hasta a ochenta mil espectadores.[24]​ Sus resultados además se vieron secundados por grandes actuaciones en la Copa del Rey, competición que disputó hasta la prohibición de la Federación a equipos filiales, y en donde eliminó a varios equipos de Primera División en sus participaciones.\n\nSanchís y Martín Vázquez fueron los primeros en debutar en la primera plantilla en Primera División, dándoles la oportunidad el entonces técnico Alfredo Di Stéfano. Fue en Murcia, el 4 de diciembre de 1983. A pesar de sus 18 años, ambos tuvieron una actuación destacada, y Sanchís incluso marcó el gol de la victoria. Unos días después, el 31 de diciembre de 1983, Pardeza disputó siete minutos con el primer equipo ante el Real Club Deportivo Español. El onubense —era el único integrante de la Quinta nacido fuera de Madrid— no tuvo la continuidad de Sanchís y Martín Vázquez, y completó la mayor parte de la temporada en el filial.[25]​\n\nApenas unos meses después, el 5 de febrero de 1984, debutó Emilio Butragueño en Cádiz. El Buitre saltó al terreno de juego cuando su equipo perdía 2-0 frente al Cádiz Club de Fútbol y revolucionó el partido con dos goles y una asistencia que culminaron la remontada madridista.[26]​\n\nMíchel fue el único que disputó toda la temporada 1983/84 en el Castilla C. F. y no le llegó la oportunidad de debutar en el primer equipo hasta el 2 de septiembre de 1984, coincidiendo con la primera jornada de la siguiente temporada.\n\nMientras Butragueño, Sanchís, Martín Vázquez y Míchel se consolidaron en el primer equipo, Pardeza militó en el Castilla durante toda la temporada 1984/85 y la 1985/86 fue cedido al Real Zaragoza. Un año después volvió a la disciplina madridista, pero en 1987 se desvinculó definitivamente del club blanco para regresar a Zaragoza.\n\nLos otros cuatro integrantes de la Quinta del Buitre convirtieron al club en uno de los mejores equipos de España y Europa durante la segunda mitad de los años 1980. Conquistaron, entre otros títulos, cinco campeonatos de Liga consecutivos (1985 a 1990), siendo la segunda vez que lo conseguía y el único club en lograrlo en la historia de la competición, una Copa de la Liga (1985), tres Supercopas de España (1988-90) y dos Copas de la UEFA (1985 y 1986).\n\nEn 1990, tras una normativa de la Federación Española que afectaba los equipos filiales, debe disolverse. Así ocurre el 1 de julio y desaparece como club pasando a ser equipo dependiente y adoptando la denominación de Real Madrid Deportivo, perdiendo además del nombre, su escudo original, y los nuevos los adoptaría ambos del primer equipo. Durante esos primeros años empiezan en el club su carrera como entrenadores dos antiguos futbolistas que pasaron por sus filas: Vicente del Bosque y Rafa Benítez. Los siguientes años alternaría descensos y ascensos entre la segunda y la segunda división \"B\" ya bajo el nombre de Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"B\" debido a normas federativas.[20]​\n\nFue entonces cuando surgirían en el equipo otros grandes talentos como Ismael Urzaiz, Santiago Cañizares, José María Gutiérrez Guti o Álvaro Benito entre otros, además de Raúl González o Iker Casillas, aunque estos últimos apenas disputaron uno y cuatro partidos en el equipo filial y fueron promocionados prematuramente al primer equipo. Grandes generaciones dentro del equipo permitieron que el filial disputase 18 temporadas en la Segunda División compitiendo con primeros equipos históricos del fútbol español. Durante la temporada 2004-2005, el equipo ascendió a la Segunda División de España, tras derrotar en la fase de ascenso al Zaragoza \"B\" y al UB Conquense en unos partidos que disputó como local en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.[27]​\n\nPor esta razón, en el verano de 2005 la Federación Española de Fútbol le concedió la petición de cambio de nombre al de Real Madrid Castilla C. F.. Sin embargo, no logra recuperar su antiguo escudo bajo la dirección del nuevo presidente Francisco Moreno Cariñena.[n 9]​ En la temporada 2005-06, disputó las dos primeras jornadas como local en el estadio Santiago Bernabéu para luego disputar el resto de la temporada en la Ciudad Deportiva de Valdebebas. Los últimas dos jornadas como local ya las pudo disputar en el recién inaugurado Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano. En la dicha temporada consiguió mantenerse pero en la temporada 2006-07 perdió la categoría al finalizar 19.º, pese a contar con una de las mejores generaciones de futbolistas que dio la cantera, con hombres como Juan Mata, Roberto Soldado o Álvaro Negredo. Desde entonces se mantuvo un lustro en la Segunda División \"B\", sin conseguir ascender a la Segunda División.[1]​\n\nEn la temporada 2010-11, ya bajo la presidencia de Nicolás Martín-Sanz, el equipo consigue acceder a la fase de ascenso a segunda división, pero cae derrotado frente al fuerte C. D. Alcoyano —que finalmente logró subir de categoría— por 0-2 en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu y tras empatar 2-2 en la vuelta en Alcoy.[20]​ Al año siguiente, queda campeón del Grupo I, lo que le permite jugar la eliminatoria directa por el ascenso contra el Cádiz CF. En el partido de ida, el Castilla vence por 0-3 a domicilio, lo que le dejó a priori un partido cómodo para la vuelta en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano, al no poder disputarse en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu por encontrarse en reformas.[28]​ En el partido de vuelta, el Castilla resuelve la eliminatoria con un 5-1 y logra el ascenso a Segunda División tras lograr un resultado global de 8-1.[29]​\n\n Posteriormente, y con el ascenso ya logrado, disputó contra el C. D. Mirandés la final para dilucidar el campeón de la Segunda División \"B\". En ella, jugada a doble partido, el Castilla derrotó al conjunto castellano-leonés por un global de 6-0, conquistando así su cuarto título de esta categoría. En aquel equipo militaron futbolistas como Jesé Rodríguez y Álvaro Morata —referentes del grupo— Dani Carvajal, Nacho Fernández, Denís Chéryshev o Lucas Vázquez entre otros, formando otra de las mejores generaciones dadas por el club.\n\nEn la nueva temporada, el Real Madrid Castilla sorprende tanto por su acierto goleador, como por su debilidad defensiva, dejando ver en sus encuentros un gran número de goles,[30]​ aunque con el paso de los partidos se fue notando su crecimiento en la nueva categoría, demostrando la gran diferencia de competitividad respecto al año anterior.[31]​ Al final del curso, batió su mejor registro goleador en la categoría, superando al Castilla de la «Quinta del Buitre» alcanzando un total de setenta y un goles,[n 10]​ dos más que los logrados en la citada campaña 1983-84 donde se proclamó campeón de la categoría.[32]​\n\nAl año siguiente, la salida de muchos de los citados futbolistas de la plantilla propició que se hubiese de reestructurar el equipo por completo lo que unido a una gran escasez goleadora —en contraposición con el curso anterior— acarreó un mal arranque liguero,[33]​ que a su vez desencadenó la destitución al frente del equipo de Alberto Toril,[34]​ entrenador del mismo desde enero de 2011.\n\nSu sucesor en el cargo, José Manuel Díaz —hasta la fecha entrenador del segundo filial, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"C\"—, trajo nuevos aires que dieron con una mejoría en el conjunto que le permitió abandonar el último lugar de la clasificación merced a cuatro victorias consecutivas encadenadas, algo que no lograba el filial en la categoría de plata desde la temporada 1988-89.[35]​ Sin embargo, una mala racha de resultados en la recta final del campeonato terminó provocando el descenso del Castilla en la última jornada del campeonato.\n\nPara afrontar el regreso a la Segunda División, el club confirmó al histórico exfutbolista francés Zinedine Zidane al frente de la plantilla,[36]​ además de llevar a cabo una reestructuración en las categorías inferiores que propició la desaparición del hasta entonces segundo filial, con el propósito de reunir únicamente en el Castilla a los mejores candidatos de ambos equipos que pudieran llegar a formar parte de la primera plantilla madridista en el futuro.[37]​[38]​\n\nTras no conseguir disputar la fase de ascenso al finalizar quintos de su grupo, se llevaron a cabo contrataciones de futbolistas con gran proyección como Carlos Abad, además de promocionar a jugadores como Borja Mayoral, Marcos Llorente o José Carlos Lazo entre otros. El equipo, del que se hizo cargo a mitad de temporada Luis Miguel Ramis debido a la promoción de Zidane al primer equipo,[39]​ realizó una buena campaña merced sobre todo al acierto goleador de Mariano Díaz, autor de 25 tantos que ayudaron al equipo se proclamase por quinta vez en su historia campeón de grupo de la división. Ello le valió para disputar la fase de ascenso en la que cayó derrotado en la ruta de los campeones frente al Universidad Católica de Murcia Club de Fútbol por un global de 4-3 en una eliminatoria llena de polémica por la excesiva dureza y permisividad de los árbitros en favor del equipo murciano,[40]​[41]​ llevándole a disputar la segunda fase de ascenso. En ella cayó en la primera eliminatoria frente al Club Lleida Esportiu tras un 0-4 global que le impidió subir a la segunda categoría del fútbol español.[42]​\n\nEl equipo no volvió a tener oportunidad de ascenso hasta la temporada 2018-19, dirigidos por Manolo Díaz, en la que nuevamente fue eliminado en el primer cruce por el Fútbol Club Cartagena. Una victoria por 3-1 en la ida fue revertida por los cartageneros al vencer en la vuelta por 2-0 y clasificarse merced al gol en campo rival en el empate técnico 3-3.[43]​ Para la nueva temporada fue contratado el exjugador y excanterano Raúl González como entrenador, hasta entonces dirigiendo al juvenil \"B\". La dificultad para planificar la plantilla con mayoría de jugadores procedentes del primer equipo juvenil a comienzo de temporada condicionó la temporada,[44]​ situándose en mitad de la tabla de clasificación al final de la primera vuelta.\n\nA mitad del curso —tras una mejora del equipo— las competiciones se cancelaron por parte de la UEFA, la RFEF y la La Liga,[45]​[46]​[47]​ debido a un brote del coronavirus tipo 2 del síndrome respiratorio agudo grave, una pandemia global vírica[48]​ que llegó a Europa desde Asia,[49]​[50]​ provocando contagios, fallecimientos y retroceso económico. Tras una mejoría después de meses de confinamiento de la población para frenar los contagios, el gobierno decretó que las competiciones profesionales pudieran retomar su actividad sin público en las gradas, no así las del resto de categorías, dándose por finalizadas tal cual se encontrasen en ese momento las clasificaciones.[51]​ Así, el equipo finalizó séptimo el campeonato.\n\nTras la reanudación de las competiciones en la temporada 2020-21, el equipo finalizó subcampeón de su grupo y se clasificó para disputar el sistema de ascenso a las nuevas categorías del fútbol español tras una reestructuración de las mismas por parte de la RFEF de cara al curso 2021-22.[52]​ En la disputa del ascenso finalizó como tercero con lo que aseguró su plaza en la Primera Federación —categoría que sustituyó a la Segunda División \"B\"— y tuvo opción de subir a la Segunda División de España, pero fue eliminado en las semifinales por la Unión Deportiva Ibiza.[53]​\n\nFue así uno de los equipos que estrenó la nueva Primera Federación, encuadrado en el grupo II y también en temporada 2023–24 , aún bajo dirección de Raúl González, donde finalizó en décima posición.\n\nEn sus inicios como A. D. Plus Ultra el club filial poseía su propio uniforme al igual que el escudo. Este constaba de camiseta azul, pantalones blancos y medias azules. Así continuó, salvo pequeñas modificaciones aunque siempre manteniendo sus colores, hasta la temporada 1972, fecha en la que se disuelve para pasar a ser oficialmente el filial del Real Madrid y tener total dependencia de él. En su primera temporada el Castilla mantiene el color azul en su equipación, pero en 1973 cambia sus colores por los de su equipo matriz, con todos sus complementos de color blanco, manteniéndose inalterable, y evolucionando al igual que el del primer equipo, hasta la actualidad.\n\nEn sus inicios como A. D. Plus Ultra poseyó un escudo propio hasta que se cambió en 1972 —fecha en la que pasó a tener total dependencia del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol— por uno propio a semejanza del club madridista.\n\nCon las iniciales de Castilla Club de Fútbol entrelazadas como en el escudo del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, la sustitución de la \"M\" por la \"C\" del Castilla, con la banda morada atravesándolo, pero sin la corona real, y con la denominación del club alrededor de un fondo azul. A partir de 1990-91, tras la normativa de filiales de la Real Federación Española de Fútbol, el club pasa a usar el escudo del Real Madrid. Hubo un intento por recuperarlo en 2005 al igual que se recuperó el nombre, pero no se consiguió y el filial sigue usando el escudo del primer equipo.\n\nEl Real Madrid Castilla disputa sus encuentros como local en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano, situado en la Ciudad Real Madrid en Valdebebas. Fue inaugurado el 9 de mayo de 2006 y posee una capacidad de 6000 espectadores,[14]​ todos sentados, y unas dimensiones de 105 x 68 metros.[14]​ La capacidad del estadio se verá aumentada a los 25 000 espectadores cuando concluyan todas las fases de construcción previstas en la Ciudad Real Madrid.[54]​\n\nLa calefacción propia, con la que el recinto puede ser también utilizado si fuese conveniente como zona de entrenamiento del club y la cubierta movible del lateral son algunas de las más novedosas técnicas de que dispone el estadio, para favorecer tanto al club como a los medios informativos y los aficionados.[54]​\n\nEl estadio fue inaugurado con un encuentro entre el primer equipo, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol y el Stade de Reims, en honor a la final de la primera Copa de Europa, máxima competición de clubes europeos, que fue ganada por el equipo blanco por 6-1. El autor del primer gol fue Sergio Ramos en el minuto 14' tras un pase de Robinho.[55]​ Antes de dicho encuentro se jugó un partido que enfrentó al equipo de veteranos del club contra un combinado de veteranos de la selección española, que precedió al acto de presentación y homenaje al presidente de honor D. Alfredo Di Stéfano, emblemático jugador del club del que toma su nombre.[54]​\n\nUna estatua de bronce del citado exfutbolista preside el acceso al estadio, representando una de sus más conocidas estampas al celebrar un gol en las semifinales de la Copa de Europa de 1957-58 frente al Budapesti Vasas S. C. en el que anotó un triplete, en la que a la postre sería la tercera Copa de Europa consecutiva del club.[56]​\n\nAntiguamente y bajo la denominación de A. D. Plus Ultra disputaba sus partidos en el extinto Velódromo de Ciudad Lineal (renombrado Estadio Antonio Borrachero el 1 de abril de 1966), el antiguo campo donde el primer equipo del Real Madrid C. F. jugó como local en la temporada 1923-24. Fue adquirido en propiedad por el club en la temporada 1945-46 en su estreno en Tercera División.[20]​\n\nDesde la temporada 1972-73, fecha en la que el club es rebautizado y refundado oficialmente como filial madridista con el nombre de Castilla C. F., hasta la temporada 1991-92, el equipo disputó sus partidos como local en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.[57]​ En la temporada 1992-93, el filial se movió a la antigua Ciudad Deportiva del Real Madrid.[58]​ Allí permaneció hasta agosto de 2004, cuando el equipo se trasladó de forma temporal a la Ciudad del Fútbol de Las Rozas para poder entrenar y jugar los partidos como local[59]​ mientras tenían lugar las obras de demolición de la antigua Ciudad Deportiva y construcción de la nueva. En octubre de 2005, se mudó definitivamente a Valdebebas, lugar de la actual Ciudad Deportiva del club: la Ciudad Real Madrid.[14]​\n\nPara la temporada 2020-21, dado que el primer equipo seguiría disputando sus encuentros como local en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano debido a las obras de remodelación que el club está acometiendo en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu y al hecho de que no se permitía el ingreso de público en los estadios de equipos profesionales en España por la pandemia de COVID-19, el Castilla pasó a jugar sus partidos en el campo 7 de la Ciudad Real Madrid.[60]​\n\nLa oficialmente denominada Ciudad Real Madrid es un complejo deportivo donde se encuentran las residencias de jugadores y los campos de entrenamiento de las distintas categorías de la sección de fútbol, además de las sedes de la radio y la televisión del club. Se encuentra situada en el Parque de Valdebebas, en el norte de Madrid, muy cercana al aeropuerto de Madrid-Barajas. Es inaugurada en el año 2005, en sustitución de la antigua Ciudad deportiva del Paseo de la Castellana, tras una recalificación de los terrenos en propiedad del club en una operación junto con el Ayuntamiento de Madrid.\n\nTiene una superficie de 1 200 000 metros cuadrados, de los que hasta el momento se han desarrollado unos 300 000. El complejo incluye además de las instalaciones médicas y de entrenamiento para el primer equipo y las secciones inferiores de fútbol, residencias y doce campos de juego, incluyendo el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano.[61]​\n\nA lo largo de su historia, el equipo madridista ha visto como el nombre del club variaba por diversas circunstancias hasta la denominación actual de Real Madrid Castilla Club de Fútbol, vigente desde 2005. El club filial se inició bajo el nombre de Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, cuando en 1947 se oficializa el acuerdo de colaboración con la entidad de seguros, y con el de Castilla Club de Fútbol tras su oficialización en 1972.\n\nA continuación se listan las distintas denominaciones de las que ha dispuesto el club a lo largo de su historia:\n• Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra: (1947-1972) Nombre bajo el acuerdo como filial con la A. D. Plus Ultra.\n• Castilla Club de Fútbol: (1972-1990) Oficialización y compra de los derechos como filial a la A. D. Plus Ultra.\n• Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"B\": (1991-2005) Cambio tras la normativa de la RFEF respecto a equipos filiales.\n• Real Madrid Castilla Club de Fútbol: (2005-Act.) Recuperación de la histórica denominación tras recibir el permiso de la RFEF.\n\nEl Castilla C. F. acumula en sus más de 66 años de historia como filial madridista numerosos trofeos nacionales. Entre sus mejores actuaciones destacan por importancia, una Liga —complementada con otras diez de divisiones inferiores— y un subcampeonato de la Copa del Rey que le permitió lograr el mayor logro deportivo de su historia: una participación en competición continental —concretamente en la Recopa de Europa y siendo equipo de Segunda División—, siendo el único filial en la historia del fútbol en lograr los tres citados honores.[62]​\n\nPosee tres récords únicos, el de único club militante de la Segunda División de España en disputar una competición europea en España, la Recopa de Europa en la temporada 1980-81 donde fue eliminado en treintaidosavos de final; el de único club filial europeo en disputar una competición internacional, la ya citada Recopa de Europa; y ser el único equipo filial en disputar una final de Copa del Rey. Estos dos últimos son inigualables al no estar ya permitida la participación de filiales tanto en competición europea como en la Copa del Rey.\n\nA raíz de su clasificación para la Recopa de Europa por su papel en la anterior Copa del Rey donde fue subcampeón tras enfrentarse al primer equipo, tanto la UEFA como la RFEF iniciaron un proceso de modificación de las normativas, efecto en la temporada 1990-91, para evitar que cualquier otro club filial pudiese participar tanto en competición nacional como internacional —a excepción de la Liga que le corresponda, siempre en divisiones inferiores a la de su primer equipo—.\n\nNota: en negrita competiciones vigentes en la actualidad. Indicado el récord del torneo\n\nSuma unos números a lo largo de sus participaciones ligueras que le han permitido colocarse en la vigesimosegunda posición histórica de la Segunda División, entre sus 172 participantes históricos,[n 11]​ superando a numerosos primeros equipos que pueden participar —a diferencia de los castillistas— en la máxima categoría del fútbol nacional. Es el mejor equipo filial en la historia del campeonato merced a sus 33 temporadas de participación,[n 12]​ y el único entre ellos en haberse proclamado campeón de la categoría,[63]​ la cual es su mejor resultado histórico. El peor lo sufrió en dos campañas, con un decimoctavo puesto.[n 13]​\n\nSu debut en Segunda División de produjo en la temporada 1949-50 en un partido frente a la Unión Deportiva Salamanca que finalizó con victoria del equipo filial madrileño —bajo su antigua denominación de A. D. Plus Ultra— por cuatro goles a tres. En lo referente a goleadas, el equipo logró su mejor victoria en la temporada 1960-61 cuando derrotó al Real Jaén Club de Fútbol por un contundente 11-0,[64]​ mientras que su peor resultado fue en la temporada 1988-89 cuando cayó derrotado frente a la Real Zaragoza por 7-0, quien fue el vencedor final de dicho torneo.[65]​\n\nEn la segunda competición por importancia, el Campeonato de España de Copa, lo disputó un total de treinta ocasiones antes de que la RFEF modificase los estatutos prohibiendo disputarla a los equipos filiales. Pese a ello, sumó un subcampeonato en 1979-80 como mejor resultado, que le permitió disputar la Recopa de Europa y ser el único equipo filial en disputarla en la historia del torneo. Su peor participación en Copa la repitió en diez ocasiones al ser eliminado en la primera ronda.[66]​\n\nDesde la temporada 1990-91 el Real Madrid Castilla C. F. no puede disputar la Copa del Rey debido a la nueva normativa de la RFEF sobre equipos filiales.\n\nHasta la temporada 1977-78 no existía la Segunda División \"B\" de fútbol en España por lo que la Tercera División —hasta entonces la tercera categoría del país—, pasó a convertirse en la cuarta categoría en detrimento de la nueva división creada. Del mismo modo, en 2021 hubo una nueva reestructuración en la que las nuevas categorías de la Federación conformaron un nuevo sistema. Así, la Segunda División \"B\" fue sustituida por la Primera Federación, y la Tercera por la Segunda División RFEF.\n\nLa Primera División y la Segunda División son las categorías profesionales de fútbol en España desde su creación en el año 1929, debido a la profesionalización de este deporte en 1925.\n\nEl equipo podría haber ascendido en tres ocasiones a la Primera División, pero por su condición de filial finalmente su derecho a ascender directamente o jugar la promoción de ascenso le correspodería al siguiente clasificado en la Liga. Estas fueron las temporadas de 1983-84, 1987-88 y 1995-96.\n\nAntes de ser nombrado Castilla C. F., por el primigenio Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra pasaron jugadores como José María Zárraga, Pedro Casado, José María Vidal, Fernando Serena, Goyo Benito, Enrique Mateos o Ramón Grosso, que posteriormente integraron e hicieron carrera en el primer equipo del club, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol,[67]​ así como otros jugadores internacionales reconocidos del fútbol patrio como Juan Manuel Villa, Feliciano Rivilla, Luis Aragonés, José Macías o Ángel Lanchas.[68]​\n\nMás tarde, por las filas del Real Madrid Castilla han pasado históricos jugadores del primer equipo procedentes de «la fábrica blanca» como: José Antonio Camacho, Isidoro San José, Isidro Díaz, García Hernández, Agustín Rodríguez, Ricardo Gallego, Francisco Pineda, José Manuel Ochotorena, Miguel Porlán Chendo, Emilio Butragueño, Míchel González, Martín Vázquez, Manolo Sanchís, Sebastián Losada, Raúl González, José María Gutiérrez Guti, Álvaro Benito, Iker Casillas, Paco Pavón, Álvaro Arbeloa, Esteban Granero, Rubén de la Red, Nacho Fernández, Dani Carvajal, Lucas Vázquez, Carlos Casemiro, Fede Valverde o Vinícius Júnior, así como futbolistas que han desarrollado el grueso de su carrera en otros equipos importantes como Juan Macua, Rafa Benítez, Juan Señor, Javier Castañeda, Javier Maté, Rafael García Cortés, Poli Rincón, Miguel Pardeza —integrante histórico de la «Quinta del Buitre»—, José Aurelio Gay, Enrique Velasco, Pepe Mel, Julio Llorente, Julen Lopetegui, José Luis Caminero, Santiago Cañizares, Ismael Urzaiz, Torres Mestre, Christopher Ohen, Mutiu Adepoju, Juan Esnáider, Luis Miguel Ramis, Dani García, José Luis Morales, Samuel Eto'o, Fernando Sanz —hijo de Lorenzo Sanz—, Luis García, Esteban Cambiasso, David Barral, Miguel Ángel Ferrer Mista, Alberto Rivera, Roberto Soldado —quien es el máximo goleador histórico del filial madridista—, Juanfran Torres, Iván Sánchez-Rico Riki, Diego López, Filipe Luís, Álvaro Negredo, Borja Valero, Juan Mata, Dani Parejo, Javi García, José Callejón, Álvaro Morata, Pablo Sarabia, o Álex Fernández, Jesé Rodríguez, Denís Chéryshev, Antonio Adán, Raúl de Tomás, Diego Llorente, Fernando Pacheco, Rubén Yáñez, Marcos Llorente, Borja Mayoral, Martin Ødegaard, Mario Hermoso, Achraf Hakimi o Sergio Reguilón como ejemplos.[67]​\n\nNota: En negrita los jugadores activos en el club.\n\nMerecen ser destacadas algunas generaciones de futbolistas del club como la generación que posteriormente conformó el «Madrid de los García» —plantilla subcampeona de la Copa de Europa que consiguió alcanzar la final del máximo torneo continental tras quince años de ausencia— o los integrantes de la «Quinta del Buitre» —equipo que conquistó cinco Ligas consecutivas y dos Copas de la UEFA—. En lo individual, los canteranos Emilio Butragueño y Raúl González fueron galardonados con dos Balones de Bronce el primero, y un Balón de Plata y un Bronze FIFA World Player el segundo.\n• Como exigen las normas de la RFEF, los dorsales de los futbolistas se comprenderán entre los números 1 y 23, reservando el 1 y el 13 para los guardametas. En caso de ser necesario un tercer guardameta con licencia en el primer equipo se le reservará el dorsal número 24. Del dorsal 25 en adelante serán a todos los efectos jugadores pertenecientes a equipos filiales o dependientes, y como tales, podrán compaginar partidos con ambos equipos. Dichos jugadores deberán portar un dorsal fijo en cada uno de los partidos que intervengan.\n• Según normativa UEFA, un canterano debe permanecer al menos tres años en edad formativa en el club (15-21 años) para ser considerado como tal. 72 ​\n• Los equipos de la Primera Federación no están limitados a tener en la plantilla un número máximo de jugadores sin pasaporte de la Unión Europea. Según normativa UEFA, cada club solo puede tener en plantilla un máximo de tres jugadores extracomunitarios que ocupen plaza de extranjero. La lista incluye sólo la principal nacionalidad de cada jugador, algunos de los jugadores no europeos tienen otra nacionalidad de algún país de la UE:\n• None Los precios no se incluye IVA o sumas por objetivos, ya que no han sido efectivos.\n\nEl vigente entrenador desde 2019 es Raúl González —quien fuera integrante tanto del filial como del primer equipo, además de ser el jugador con más partidos disputados como madridista (741) y su máximos goleador histórico al momento de su retirada profesional (323 goles)—.[75]​ Tras superar el curso de entrenador UEFA Pro[76]​ pasó a formar parte de las divisiones inferiores del club en donde fue desarrollando su labor como técnico por las diferentes categorías logrando varios campeonatos.[77]​ En la temporada 2019-20 se convierte en el primer entrenador del filial, y momentáneamente del juvenil tras suspenderse las competiciones por la pandemia de COVID-19, para proclamarse Campeón de Europa.[78]​ Retomadas las competiciones, el equipo obtuvo plaza en la nueva Primera Federación.\n\nEntre los entrenadores del club también figuran otros exjugadores del club como Antonio Ruiz, Manuel Sanchís, Juan Santisteban —quien más partidos dirigió—, Amancio Amaro —quien dirigió a la «Quinta del Buitre»—, Ramón Grosso, Vicente del Bosque, Mariano García Remón, Rafa Benítez, Francisco García Hernández, Toni Grande, Paco Buyo, Míchel González, Zinedine Zidane o Santiago Solari por citar algunos.[79]​ Antes de todos ellos, cuando el equipo era aún la Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, contó con ilustres exintegrantes del club como Antonio Bonet,[80]​ o Miguel Muñoz —antes de convertirse en el entrenador con más partidos dirigidos del primer equipo—.[81]​\n\nPese a que el club y sus competencias pertenecen al Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, el equipo filial ha contado con presidencia propia desde sus inicios hasta el año 1990. Tras dieciséis años sin presidente propio, y siendo el presidente de la entidad Florentino Pérez, instauró el 28 de julio de 2006 de nuevo el antiguo privilegio a Francisco Moreno Cariñena, socio de la entidad y compromisario desde 1982, nombrándole así primer máximo mandatario del filial blanco desde hacía décadas. El mandatario ya fue además directivo del Castilla desde 1988 hasta la llegada de Ramón Mendoza a la presidencia blanca. Este último fue sucedido en el cargo por Lorenzo Sanz.\n\nEn la actualidad la presidencia del equipo filial recae en Nicolás Martín-Sanz, tras suceder en el cargo al guadalajareño, quien obtuviese el cargo en el año 2009.\n\nA continuación se listan los presidentes de la historia del club filial:\n• None (2008).

He was a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize in 1951. He was one of the founders of the Italian Republic and a central figure of the Italian political left from the 1920s to the 1960s.\n\nNenni was born in Faenza, in Emilia-Romagna. After his peasant parents died, he was placed in an orphanage by an aristocratic family. Every Sunday, he recited his catechism before the countess and if he did well, he received a silver coin, which he recalled as \"generous but humiliating\".[3]\n\nNenni was affiliated with the Italian Republican Party. In 1908, he became editor of a republican paper in Forlì. The socialist paper in the town was edited at the time by Benito Mussolini, later the Fascist dictator of Italy. In 1909 he entered political life by joining the Italian Republican party. Nenni was arrested in 1911 for his participation in a socialist protest against Italy's imperialistic war in Libya alongside Mussolini and was imprisoned for seven months.[4]\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, Nenni advocated the intervention of Italy in the war. In 1915, he volunteered for the Isonzo front. After he was wounded and sent home, he became an editor of the republican paper Mattine d'Italia. He defended Italy's participation in the war but tried not to alienate his socialist friends. In the last years of the war Nenni served at the front again.[4]\n\nWhen the war was over, Nenni founded, together with some disillusioned revolutionary ex-servicemen, a group called \"Fascio\", which was soon dissolved and replaced by a real Fascist body.[4] While the socialist Mussolini became a fascist, the republican Nenni joined the Socialist Party in 1921 after its split with the wing that would form the Italian Communist Party (PCI).\n\nIn 1923, after the Fascist March on Rome, Nenni became the editor of PSI's official organ, Avanti!, and engaged in antifascist activism. In 1925 he was arrested for publishing a booklet on the fascist murder of Socialist leader Giacomo Matteotti. When the Avanti offices were set aflame and the paper prohibited in 1926, he took refuge in France, where he became secretary of the PSI.\n\nNenni had worked in Paris as a correspondent of the Avanti in 1921 and had become acquainted with Léon Blum, Marcel Cachin, Romain Rolland and Georges Sorel. During his Parisian exile, Nenni made a decisive contribution to the survival of the Italian Socialist Party, which had moved abroad, and he worked for an alliance between the various anti-fascist parties which had been driven into exile. In 1935, he helped lead the Italian opposition to Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia. Nenni went on to fight with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He was the co-founder and the political commissar of the Garibaldi Brigade. After the defeat of the Spanish Republic and the victory of General Francisco Franco he returned to France. In 1943, he was arrested by the Germans in Vichy France and then imprisoned in Italy on the island of Ponza.\n\nNenni's third daughter, Vittoria, was active in the French resistance. She was captured and deported to Auschwitz, where she was murdered on 15 July 1943, aged 28.[5] After being liberated in August 1943, he returned to Rome to lead the Italian Socialist Party, which had been reunified as the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity. After the surrender of Italy with the Allied armed forces on 8 September 1943, he was one of the political officials of the National Liberation Committee, the underground political entity of Italian Partisans during the German occupation.\n\nIn 1944, Nenni became the national secretary of the PSI again, favoring close ties between his party and the PCI. After the Liberation, he took up government responsibilities, becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Constituent Assembly in the government of Ferruccio Parri and the first government of Alcide De Gasperi. He was Minister for the Constitution, and in October 1946 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in the second De Gasperi government.\n\nThe close ties between the PSI and the PCI caused the Giuseppe Saragat-led anti-communist wing of the PSI to leave and form the Italian Socialist Workers' Party in 1947 (later merged into the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, PSDI). During the early stage of the cold war he opposed Italy's entry into NATO fearing that it could drag the country into a war between the two Superpowers and reignite the Italian civil war and instead favoured a policy of Neutrality. In 1951 he was awarded the Stalin peace prize.\n\nIn 1956, Nenni broke with the PCI after Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary.[6] He returned the award and donated the Prize money ($25,000) to the International red Cross.[3] Subsequently, he slowly led his party into supporting membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and he sought co-operation with the leading party, the Christian Democrats.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Nenni facilitated an \"opening to the centre-left\" enabling coalition governments between the PSI and the Christian Democrats and leading the socialists back into office for the first time since 1947.[7] He formed a centre-left coalition with Saragat, Aldo Moro and Ugo La Malfa, and favored a reunion with the PSDI. From 1963 to 1968 he was Deputy Prime Minister in the three successive governments led by Moro and in December 1968 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in the first government of Mariano Rumor, but resigned in July 1969, when the center-left alliance collapsed.[citation needed]\n\nAlthough the reunification attempts between the socialists and Giuseppe Saragat's breakaway Social Democrats resulted in the formation of a joint list Unified PSI–PSDI, both parties fared poorly in the 1968 Italian general election. In 1969, a disillusioned Nenni virtually retired and Francesco De Martino took his place.[8] He resigned as head of the PSI and was made a senator for life in 1970 and in 1971 he ran unsuccessfully for President of Italy. He died in Rome on 1 January 1980. She is commemorated in the writings of Charlotte Delbo.[citation needed] He was an atheist.[9]\n• Address given by Pietro Nenni on the military intervention in Czechoslovakia, Rome, 29 August 1968\n• Newspaper clippings about Pietro Nenni in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBWPietro Nenni - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Pietro Sandro Nenni (Faenza, 9 de febrero de 1891 - Roma, 1 de enero de 1980) fue un político socialista italiano.[1]​\n\nNacido en Faenza, en la provincia de Ravenna, de una familia modesta: sus padres José y Angela Castellani estaban al servicio de los condes de Ginnasi.\n\nNenni quedó huérfano de padre cuando tenía solo cinco años (1896).\n\nNenni fue periodista y posteriormente se convirtió en político. En 1911 fue encarcelado por organizar una manifestación en contra de la invasión italiana de Libia. En su estancia en la cárcel conoció a Benito Mussolini. En 1921 se afilió al Partido Socialista Italiano (PSI). En 1922 como redactor jefe del periódico Avanti!, atacó duramente a Mussolini que había llegado ese mismo año al poder. El periódico fue definitivamente clausurado en 1926 y Nenni se exilió a Francia, siendo elegido secretario general del PSI.\n\nEn 1936 participó en la guerra civil española como comisario político de la Brigada Garibaldi.[2]​\n\nDespués de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y de nuevo en Italia, ocupó distintos cargos gubernamentales, entre ellos los de vicepresidente del consejo de ministros (1945-1946) y Ministro de Asuntos Exteriores (1946-1947). Como consecuencia de la división del PSI, Nenni se quedó a la cabeza del bando más a la izquierda, aliándose con los comunistas, con los que rompió en 1957 debido a la invasión de Hungría.\n\nEn 1963, su entrada como vicepresidente de un gobierno de centro-izquierda originó la escisión del ala izquierda socialista que dio nacimiento al PSIUP. ​ Tras la reunificación en 1966, fue elegido presidente del partido y ocupó nuevamente el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores en 1968. En 1969 dimitió de todos sus cargos al salir derrotada en el congreso del partido su moción favorable a la continuación de la alianza centro-izquierda.\n\nEn 1970, fue nombrado senador vitalicio. Años más tarde volvió a presidir el Partido Socialista y en 1978 se presentó con este partido como candidato para la presidencia de la República.Pietro Nenni | Socialist leader, Italian statesman, anti-fascist | Britannica: Pietro Nenni (born February 9, 1891, Faenza, Italy—died January 1, 1980, Rome) was a journalist and politician who was leader of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), twice foreign minister, and several times vice-premier of Italy.\n\nThe son of a peasant, Nenni first became a journalist. When Italy invaded Libya in September 1911, Nenni organized a strike against the campaign. He was jailed for his activities and met Benito Mussolini in prison. He joined the PSI in 1921. In 1922, when Mussolini came to power, Nenni, an ardent antifascist, attacked him in the newspaper Avanti, of which he was chief editor. In 1925 he was arrested for publishing a booklet on the Fascists’ murder of Socialist leader Giacomo Matteotti, and in the following year, after the suppression of Avanti, he fled to Paris. During the Spanish Civil War, Nenni was cofounder and political commissar of the Garibaldi Brigade. In 1940 he was arrested in Vichy France by the German Gestapo, taken back to Italy in 1943, and interned on the island of Ponza by Mussolini. In August of the same year, he was released by order of Marshal Pietro Badoglio. Nenni was then elected secretary-general of the PSI and in 1945 became vice-premier in the government of Feruccio Parri. Elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1946, he became vice-premier again in Christian Democrat Alcide De Gasperi’s coalition government. In 1946 Nenni was named foreign minister, but in January 1947 the PSI split and Nenni, heading the party’s left wing, made an alliance with the Communists. For almost a decade the alliance opposed Christian Democrat governments.\n\nNenni broke with the Communists after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. In 1963 he finally brought the PSI back into a full-fledged coalition with the Christian Democrats under Aldo Moro. He served as foreign minister in 1968–69 and was vice-premier in three successive cabinets, but, when the centre-left alliance collapsed in 1969, Nenni resigned as head of the PSI. Nenni was made a senator for life in 1970.Fondazione Pietro Nenni: An analysis of policies to empower labour in the digital workplacePremier League Football News, Fixtures, Scores & Results: Who is Man City's new signing Vitor Reis and how will he fit in?\n\nOpta Analyst's Oliver Hopkins looks at the Brazilian centre-back's stats and story so far1951 - Wikipedia: 阳金虎年\n\n(male Iron-Tiger)\n\n2077 or 1696 or 924\n\n — to —\n\n阴金兔年\n\n(female Iron-Rabbit)\n\n2078 or 1697 or 925The 1951 Refugee Convention: Refugees are in extremely vulnerable circumstances, lacking the protection of their own countries and facing immense challenges to their safety and well-being.

It consists of chips of marble, quartz, granite, glass, or other suitable material, poured with a cementitious binder (for chemical binding), polymeric (for physical binding), or a combination of both. Metal strips often divide sections, or changes in color or material in a pattern. Additional chips may be sprinkled atop the mix before it sets. After it is cured it is ground and polished smooth or otherwise finished to produce a uniformly textured surface. \"Terrazzo\" is also often used to describe any pattern similar to the original terrazzo floors.[1] Modern forms of terrazzo include polished concrete.\n\nAlthough the history of terrazzo can be traced back to the ancient mosaics of Egypt, its more recent predecessors come from Italy. The form of terrazzo used today derives partly from the 18th century pavimento alla Veneziana (Venetian pavement) and the cheaper seminato. Pavimento alla Veneziana had workers place marble fragments next to each other in a mortar base. Terrazzo is also related to the technique seminato for which workers tossed larger marble chips into the cement that was then ground and polished. Together, these methods create the generic form of terrazzo that involves pieces of stone that are bonded to a cement bed. Terrazzo was first introduced in the United States in the late 1890s, but did not achieve popularity until the 1920s.[2] Until then it was hand polished with a long handled tool called a galera.[2] Due to its likelihood of cracking, terrazzo was used at a small scale in comparison to the large expanses we see today. Two inventions resulted in its rise in popularity: divider strips and the electric grinding machine. The invention of divider strips by L. Del Turco and Bros. in 1924 contained the cracking of terrazzo by allowing the material greater space to expand and shrink after installation. This invention made terrazzo a durable and reliable material in addition to allowing for further design work within the floor.[3] Installers use the dividing strips as guides when they work with different colored terrazzo. Additionally, the electric grinding machine and mechanization of the production process cut down on costs and installation time, making terrazzo an affordable flooring option.\n\nArt Deco and Moderne styles from the 1920s to 1940s favored terrazzo with the dividers allowing for straight or curved lines that increased the decorative potential.[4] The popularity of terrazzo led to an increase in installers in the 1920s. The National Terrazzo and Mosaic Organization was formed in 1931 to further professionalize the practice of terrazzo installation.[5] One of the best-known examples of terrazzo is the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Created in 1958, the walk honors celebrities in the form of a terrazzo star that displays their name.[6]\n\nArchaeologists have adopted the term terrazzo to describe the floors of early Neolithic buildings (PPNA and PPNB, ca. 9,000–8,000 BC) in Western Asia constructed of burnt lime and clay, colored red with ochre and polished. The embedded crushed limestone gives it a slightly mottled appearance. The use of fire to produce burnt lime, which was also used for the hafting of implements, predates production of fired pottery by almost a thousand years.[citation needed] In the early Neolithic settlement of Çayönü in eastern Turkey about 90 m2 (970 sq ft) of terrazzo floors have been uncovered. The floors of the PPN B settlement of Nevalı Çori measure about 80 m2 (860 sq ft). They are 15 cm (5.9 in) thick, and contain about 10–15% lime.\n\nThese floors are almost impenetrable to moisture and very durable, but their construction involved a high input of energy. Gourdin and Kingery (1975) estimate that the production of any given amount of lime requires about five times that amount of wood.[7][clarification needed] Recent experiments by Affonso and Pernicka[8] have shown that only twice the amount is needed, but that would still amount to 4.5 metric tonnes of dry wood for the floors in Çayönü. Other sites with terrazzo floors include Nevalı Çori, Göbekli Tepe, Jericho, and Kastros (Cyprus).\n\nTerrazzo artisans create walls, floors, patios, and panels by exposing marble chips and other fine aggregates on the surface of finished concrete or epoxy-resin. Much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers is similar to that of cement masons. Marble-chip, cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials. First, cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid, level concrete foundation that is 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102 mm) deep. After the forms are removed from the foundation, workers add a 1 inch (25 mm) layer of sandy concrete. Before this layer sets, terrazzo workers partially embed metal divider strips in the concrete wherever there is to be a joint or change of color in the terrazzo. For the final layer, terrazzo workers blend and place into each of the panels a fine marble chip mixture that may be color-pigmented. While the mixture is still wet, workers toss additional marble chips of various colors into each panel and roll a weighted roller (100–125 pounds (45–57 kg)) over the entire surface.\n\nIn the 1970s, polymer-based terrazzo was introduced and is called thin-set terrazzo. Initially polyester and vinyl ester resins were used as the binder resin. Today, most of the terrazzo installed is epoxy terrazzo. The advantages of this material over cementitious terrazzo include a wider selection of colors, 1⁄4 to 3⁄8 inch (6.4 to 9.5 mm) installation thickness, lighter weight, faster installation, impermeable finish, higher strength, and less susceptibility to cracking. The disadvantage of epoxy resin–based terrazzo is that it can only be used for interior, not exterior, applications. Epoxy-based terrazzo will lose its color and slightly peel when used outdoors, whereas cement-based terrazzo will not. In addition to marble aggregate blends, other aggregates have been used, such as mother of pearl and abalone shell. Recycled aggregates include: glass, porcelain, concrete, and metal. Shapes and medallions can be fabricated on site by bending divider strips, or off site by water-jet cutting.\n\nWhen the terrazzo is thoroughly cured, helpers grind it with a terrazzo grinder, which is somewhat like a floor polisher, only much heavier. Slight depressions left by the grinding are filled with a matching grout material and hand-troweled for a smooth, uniform surface; it is then cleaned, polished, and sealed.[9]\n\nTerrazzo installation includes both bonded and unbonded methods. Bonded systems include: bonded underbed, monolithic, chemically bonded, and the most recent, thin set method (epoxy resin). Bonded terrazzo is applied over a sand-cement mortar underbed which sits on top of a concrete slab. The sand-cement layer allows for variations in the finished concrete slab that it sits on. Monolithic terrazzo is applied directly over an extremely flat and high quality concrete sub-floor. Thin-set terrazzo does not require a concrete sub-floor. Instead, a flexible membrane can be installed so that cracks do not appear on the surface.[10] Unbonded includes the sand cushion method which uses wire reinforcing, an isolation sheet, and sand dusting that absorbs any movement from the concrete slab.[11]\n\nAlthough terrazzo derives from the mosaic artform, it does not necessarily place individual pieces in a decorative pattern. Instead, small pieces are thrown into the mortar base creating a more uniform surface appearance. Decorative patterns are often created by using dividers which creates lines between different colored terrazzo mixtures.\n\nCracking is a common form of failure and is often caused by the structural system that supports the terrazzo rather than the material itself. Contact with alkalis or acids can deteriorate the bonding agents used in terrazzo. As the aggregates are often marble dust which is calcium carbonate, strong acid can also cause deterioration to the aggregates. When partial replacement is necessary, a \"bracketing\" system mixing and matching different chips is used to create potential matches.[11] Aged terrazzo can be resurfaced to restore its original look by re-polishing.[12]The Terrazzo: The main buildings in the Cadet Area surround a large pavilion known as The Terrazzo, designed by landscape architect Dan Kiley. The name comes from the walkway’s terrazzo tiles that are set among a checkerboard of marble strips.\n\nWith the building of Sijan Hall on the south side of the Terrazzo in 1968, the Terrazzo area was enclosed, creating a large quadrangle. Only the top of the hill, now known as “Spirit Hill,” remains in the central grassy area of the Terrazzo. At the east end of the Terrazzo are the “Air Gardens,” 700-feet of lighted pools, lowered grass sections and maze-like walkways.\n\nSeveral retired aircraft now call the Terrazzo home, including:\n\nThis 1976 model F-15 flew most of its career with the 48th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (FIS) at Langley AFB, VA. The 48 FIS flew the jet on intercept missions for the Southeast Air Defense Sector. The jet was painted in the colors of Tyndall AFB, FL, for its last few missions before it was retired on 30 November 1992. It was donated in 1993.\n\nThis is the only aircraft credited with six MiG kills since the Korean War. Captain Richard S. Ritchie, Class of 1964, made his first and fifth kills in this aircraft. It was presented to the Academy in 1986.Township of Verona NJ - Home - New: Get it DoneVerona, WI - Official Website | Official Website: \n• Century School Park Ice Rink: Rental Skates are now available!

The metropolitan area of Verona covers an area of 1,426 km2 (550.58 sq mi) and has a population of 714,310 inhabitants.[4] It is one of the main tourist destinations in Northern Italy because of its artistic heritage and several annual fairs and shows as well as the opera season in the Arena, an ancient Roman amphitheater.\n\nBetween the 13th and 14th centuries, the city was ruled by the della Scala family. Under the rule of the family, in particular of Cangrande I della Scala, the city experienced great prosperity, becoming rich and powerful and being surrounded by new walls.[5] The della Scala era is preserved in numerous monuments around Verona.\n\nTwo of William Shakespeare's plays are set in Verona: Romeo and Juliet (which also features Romeo's visit to Mantua) and The Two Gentlemen of Verona. It is unknown if Shakespeare ever visited Verona or Italy, but his plays have lured many visitors to Verona and surrounding cities. Verona was also the birthplace of Isotta Nogarola, who is said to be the first major female humanist and one of the most important humanists of the Renaissance.[6] In November 2000, the city was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its urban structure and architecture.\n\nThe city is scheduled to host the 2026 Winter Olympics closing ceremonies.\n\nThe precise details of Verona's early history remain a mystery along with the origin of its name. One theory is that it was a city of the Euganei, who were obliged to give it up to the Cenomani (550 BC). With the conquest of the Valley of the Po, the Veronese territory became Roman about 300 BC. Verona became a Roman colonia in 89 BC. It was classified as a municipium in 49 BC, when its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe Poblilia or Publicia.\n\nThe city became important because it was at the intersection of several roads. Stilicho, a military commander in the Roman army, defeated Alaric and his Visigoths here in 402. Later, Verona was conquered by the Ostrogoths in 489, and the Gothic domination of Italy began. Theoderic the Great was said to have built a palace there. It remained under the power of the Goths throughout the Gothic War (535–552), except for a single day in 541, when the Byzantine officer Artabazes made an entrance. The defections of the Byzantine generals over the booty made it possible for the Goths to regain possession of the city. In 552 the Romans under the general Valerian vainly endeavored to enter the city, but it was only when the Goths were fully overthrown that they surrendered it.[7]\n\nIn 569, it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards,[8] in whose kingdom it was, in a sense, the second most important city. There, Alboin was \"killed by his own people with the connivance of his wife\" in 572.[9] The dukes of Treviso often resided there. Adalgisus, son of Desiderius, in 774 made his last resistance in Verona to Charlemagne, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom.[10] Verona became the ordinary residence of the kings of Italy, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there.\n\nUnder Holy Roman and Austrian rule, Verona was alternatively known in German as Bern, Welsch-Bern[11] or Dietrichsbern. Otto I ceded to Verona the marquisate dependent on the Duchy of Bavaria, however, the increasing wealth of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1135 Verona was organised as a free commune. In 1164 Verona joined with Vicenza, Padua and Treviso to create the Veronese League, which was integrated with the Lombard League in 1167 to battle against Frederick I Barbarossa. Victory was achieved at the Battle of Legnano in 1176, and the Treaty of Venice signed in 1177 followed by the Peace of Constance in 1183.[12]\n\nWhen Ezzelino III da Romano was elected podestà in 1226, he converted the office into a permanent lordship. In 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona).[clarification needed] Upon his death, the Great Council elected Mastino I della Scala as podestà, and he converted the \"signoria\" into a family possession, though leaving the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podestà in 1262, he affected a coup d'état, and was acclaimed Capitano del Popolo, with the command of the communal troops. Long internal discord took place before he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podestà. In 1277, Mastino della Scala was killed by the faction of the nobles.\n\nThe reign of his son Alberto della Scala as capitano (1277–1302) was a time of incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and Cangrande I della Scala (1291–1329), only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or treaty, he brought under his control the cities of Treviso (1308), Vicenza (1311), and Padua (1328). At that time before the Black Death, the city was home to more than 40,000 people.[13]\n\nCangrande was succeeded by Mastino II (1329–1351) and Alberto, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle's policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Mincio. He purchased Parma (1335) and Lucca (1339). After the King of France, he was the richest prince of his time. A powerful league was formed against him in 1337 – Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este, and the Gonzaga. After a three-year war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and Vicenza (Mastino's daughter Regina-Beatrice della Scala married to Barnabò Visconti). Mastino's son Cangrande II (1351–1359) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburgian mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359–1375), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a family custom, for Antonio (1375–1387), Cansignorio's natural brother, slew his brother Bartolomeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight on 19 October 1387, thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments.\n\nThe year 1387 is also the year of the Battle of Castagnaro, fought between Giovanni Ordelaffi for Verona and John Hawkwood for Padua. The latter emerged as the winner.\n\nAntonio's son Canfrancesco attempted in vain to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate; with the support of the people and the Carraresi, he drove out the Milanese, but he died ten days after. After a period of Cararrese rule, Verona submitted to Venice (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings.\n\nFrom 1508 to 1517, the city was in the power of the Emperor Maximilian I. There were numerous outbreaks of the plague, and in 1629–1633, Italy was struck by its worst outbreak in modern times. Around 33,000 people died in Verona (over 60% of the population at the time) in 1630–1631.[14]\n\nIn 1776, a method of bellringing was developed called Veronese bellringing art. Verona was occupied by Napoleon in 1797, but on Easter Monday the populace rose and drove out the French. It was then that Napoleon made an end of the Venetian Republic. Verona became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. It was taken from Austria by the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy, but was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.\n\nThe Congress of Verona, which met on 20 October 1822, was part of the series of international conferences or congresses, opening with the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815, that marked the continuing enforcement of the \"Concert of Europe\".\n\nIn 1866, following the Third Italian War of Independence, Verona, along with the rest of Venetia, became part of a united Italy.\n\nThe advent of fascism added another dark chapter to the annals of Verona. Throughout Italy, the Jewish population was hit by the Manifesto of Race, a series of anti-Semitic laws passed in 1938, and after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1943, deportations to Nazi concentration camps. An Austrian Fort (now a church, the Santuario della Madonna di Lourdes), was used to incarcerate and torture Allied troops, Jews and anti-fascists, especially after 1943, when Verona became part of the Italian Social Republic.\n\nDuring Austrian rule Verona became of great strategic importance to the regime. Galeazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini's son-in-law, was accused of plotting against the republic; in a show trial staged in January 1944 by the Nazi and fascist hierarchy at Castelvecchio (the Verona trial), Ciano was executed on the banks of the Adige with many other officers on what is today Via Colombo. This marked another turning point in the escalation of violence that would only end with the final liberation by allied troops and partisans on 26 April 1945.\n\nAfter World War II, as Italy joined the NATO alliance, Verona once again acquired its strategic importance, due to its geographical closeness to the Iron Curtain. The city became the seat of SETAF (South European Allied Terrestrial Forces) and had during the whole duration of the Cold War period a strong military presence, especially American, which has since decreased.\n\nVerona has a humid subtropical climate characteristic of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot summers and cool, humid winters, even though Lake Garda has a partial influence on the city.[15] The relative humidity is high throughout the year, especially in winter when it causes fog, mainly from dusk until late morning, although the phenomenon has become less and less frequent in recent years.\n\nIn 2009, 265,368 people were residing in Verona, located in the province of Verona, Veneto, of whom 47.6% were male and 52.4% were female. Minors (children aged 0–17) totaled 16.05% of the population compared to pensioners who numbered 22.36%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Verona residents is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Verona grew by 3.05%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%.[21] The current birth rate of Verona is 9.24 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\n\nAs of 2009 , 87% of the population was Italian.[22] The largest immigrant group comes from other European nations (the largest coming from Romania): 3.60%, South Asia: 2.03%, and sub-saharan Africa 1.50%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, but due to immigration now has some Orthodox Christian, and Muslim followers.\n\nSince the local government political reorganization in 1993, Verona has been governed by the City Council of Verona, which is based in Palazzo Barbieri. Voters elect directly 33 councilors and the mayor of Verona every five years.\n\nVerona is also the capital of its own province. The Provincial Council is seated in Palazzo del Governo. The current mayor of Verona is Damiano Tommasi, elected on 26 June 2022.[23]\n\nVerona has traditionally been a right-wing traditionalist Catholic city, reflecting its former status as one of the major cities of Italian Social Republic, and the right-wing politics of the Veneto region. In October 2018, Verona became the first city in Italy to declare itself pro-life, and hosted the American Christian right lobby group World Congress of Families' conference in 2019.[24][25][26] Despite this, since the mayors became directly elected in 1994, the city has elected two left-wing mayors - Paolo Zanotto in 2002 and current mayor Damiano Tommasi in 2022, largely due to incumbent mayor Federico Sboarina's refusal to include center-right parties in his right-wing coalition.[27]\n\nBecause of the value and importance of its many historical buildings, Verona has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Verona preserved many ancient Roman monuments (including the magnificent Arena) in the early Middle Ages, but many of its early medieval edifices were destroyed or heavily damaged by the earthquake of 3 January 1117, which led to a massive Romanesque rebuilding. The Carolingian period Versus de Verona contains an important description of Verona in the early medieval era.\n\nThe Roman military settlement in what is now the center of the city was to expand through the cardines and decumani that intersect at right angles. This structure has been kept to the present day and is clearly visible from the air. Further development has not reshaped the original map. Though the Roman city with its basalt-paved roads is mostly hidden from view it stands virtually intact about 6 m below the surface. Most palazzi and houses have cellars built on Roman structures that are rarely accessible to visitors.\n\nVerona is famous for its Roman amphitheater, the Arena, found in the city's largest piazza, the Piazza Bra. Completed around 30 AD, it is the third-largest in Italy after Rome's Colosseum and the Amphitheatre of Capua. It measures 139 meters long and 110 meters wide, and could seat some 25,000 spectators in its 44 tiers of marble seats. The ludi (shows and gladiator games) performed within its walls were so famous that they attracted spectators from far beyond the city. The current two-story façade is actually the internal support for the tiers; only a fragment of the original outer perimeter wall in white and pink limestone from Valpolicella, with three stories remains. The interior is very impressive and is virtually intact, and has remained in use even today for public events, fairs, theatre, and open-aired opera during warm summer nights.\n\nPiazza delle Erbe, near the Roman forum was rebuilt by Cangrande I and Cansignorio della Scala I, lords of Verona, using material (such as marble blocks and statues) from Roman spas and villas.\n\nThere is also a variety of other Roman monuments to be found in the town, such as the Roman theatre of Verona. This theatre was built in the 1st century BC, but through the ages had fallen in disuse and had been built upon to provide housing. In the 18th century Andrea Monga, a wealthy Veronese, bought all the houses that in time had been built over the theatre, demolished them, and saved the monument. Not far from it is the Ponte di Pietra (\"Stone Wall Bridge\"), another Roman landmark that has survived to this day.\n\nThe Arco dei Gavi was built in the 1st century AD and is famous for having the name of the builder (architect Lucius Vitruvius Cordone) engraved on it, a rare case in the architecture of the epoque. It originally straddled the main Roman road into the city, now Corso Cavour. It was demolished by French troops in 1805 and rebuilt in 1932.\n\nNearby is the Porta Borsari, an archway at the end of Corso Porta Borsari. This is the façade of a 3rd-century gate in the original Roman city walls. The inscription is dated 245 AD and gives the city name as Colonia Verona Augusta. Corso Porta Borsari, the road passing through the gate is the original Via Sacra of the Roman city. Today, it is lined with several Renaissance palazzi and the ancient Church of Santi Apostoli, a few meters from Piazza delle Erbe.\n\nPorta Leoni is the 1st century BC ruin of what was once part of the Roman city gate. A substantial portion is still standing as part of the wall of a medieval building. The street itself is an open archaeological site, and the remains of the original Roman street and gateway foundations can be seen a few feet below the present street level. As can be seen from there, the gate contains a small court guarded by towers. Here, carriages and travelers were inspected before entering or leaving the city.\n\nThe Santo Stefano church is dedicated to the first Christian martyr, was erected in the Paleochristian era, and houses the burials of the first bishops of Verona. Throughout the centuries Saint Stephen underwent complex architectural transformations. Particularly striking is the rare two-story ambulatory, probably built to give pilgrims visual access to the abundant collection of important relics for which the church was famous. Also to be visited is the cruciform crypt with its forest of columns, arches, and cross vaults. Saint Stephen was the first Christian martyr and, according to the Acts of the Apostles, was stoned just outside Jerusalem, in a place still remembered today, near the so-called \"Porta Leoni\".[28]\n\nThe Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore is a Romanesque style church, the third such structure on its site, built from 1123 to 1135, over the 4th-century shrine to Verona's patron saint, St. Zeno (bishop of Verona from 362 to 380[29] when he died). The façade dominates the large square, and is flanked with a 72-meter-tall bell tower, which is mentioned by Dante in Canto 18 of Purgatory in the Divine Comedy. The weathered Veronese stone gives a warm golden glow, and the restrained lines of the pillars, columns, and cornices, and the gallery with its double windows, give the façade an air of harmonious elegance. The huge rose window is decorated as a Wheel of Fortune. The lintels above the portal have carvings of the months of the year. Each side of the doorway is embellished with 18 bas-relief panels of biblical scenes, and the inner bronze door panels have 48 primitive but forceful depictions of Biblical scenes and episodes from the life of St Zeno. The meaning of some of the scenes is now unknown, but the extraordinarily vivid energy of the figures is a superb blend of traditional and Ottonian influences. The interior of the church is divided into the Lower Church, occupying about ⅔ of the structure, and the Upper Church, occupying the remainder. The walls are covered with 12th and 14th century frescos and the ceiling of the nave is a magnificent example of a ship's keel ceiling. The vaulted crypt contains the tomb of St. Zeno, the first Bishop of Verona, as well as the tombs of several other saints. North of the church is a pleasant cloister. The church also houses the tomb of King Pippin of Italy (777–810).\n\nPiazza dei Signori is an elegant medieval square with various buildings and towers. It has a monument dedicated to Dante Alighieri.\n\nThe Basilica of San Lorenzo is another Romanesque church, albeit smaller. It dates from around 1177, but was built on the site of a Paleochristian church, fragments of which remain. The church is built of alternating tracks of brick and stone, and has two cylindrical towers, housing spiral staircases to the women's galleries. The interior is sober but still quiet. The striped bands of stone and brick and the graceful arches complement the setting.\n\nSanta Maria Antica is a small Romanesque church that served as the private chapel of the Scaligeri clan, and is famous for the Gothic Scaliger Tombs.\n\nThe Verona Cathedral, also known as the Duomo, is a notable Romanesque church.\n\nSant'Anastasia is a huge and lofty church built from 1290 to 1481 by the Dominicans to hold the massive congregations attracted by their sermons. The Pellegrini chapel houses the fresco St. George and the Princess of Trebizond by Pisanello as well as the grave of Wilhelm von Bibra. An art festival is held in the square each May.\n\nThe Castelvecchio Bridge, also known as Ponte Scaligero, is a segmental arch bridge. At the time of its completion in 1356, it was the world's largest bridge arch. It has a span length of 48.70 m (159.78 ft).\n\nThe city has two professional football teams. Historically, the city's major team has been Hellas Verona. They won the Italian Serie A championship in 1984–85 and played in the European Cup the following year. Chievo Verona represented Chievo, a suburb of Verona, and was created in 1929. However, they ceased to exist in 2021 due to outstanding tax payments. As of the 2021–22 season, Hellas plays in the first division of Italian football, Serie A, while Virtus Verona, the other club in the city, plays in the Serie C. The teams of Hellas and Chievo contested the Derby della Scala and shared the 38,402-seater Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi (now only home to Hellas due to the fold of Chievo), which was used as a venue at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\n\nVerona is home to the volleyball team Verona Volley (now in Serie A1), the rugby team Franklin and Marshall Cus Verona Rugby (now in Serie A1), and the basketball team Scaligera Basket (now in Legadue).\n\nThe city has twice hosted the UCI Road World Championships, in 1999 (with Treviso as co-host) and in 2004. The city also regularly hosts stages of the Giro d'Italia annual cycling race. Verona also hosted the baseball world cup in 2009, and the Volleyball World Cup in September–October 2010. Verona is hosting the Volleyball Women's World Championship in September–October 2014.[30]\n\nPublic transit has been operated by the provincial public transport company, Azienda Trasporti Verona (ATV), since 2007. From 1884 to 1951, the city was served by the Verona tram network [it]. Trolleybuses replaced the trams which were themselves replaced by buses in 1975. A new trolleybus network is currently under construction by ATV and is expected to open in 2026.[31]\n\nAn incline lift, the Verona funicular, opened in 2017 and provides access from the Ponte Pietra to the Roman theatre museum and San Pietro Castle.\n\nVerona lies at a major route crossing where the north–south rail line from the Brenner Pass to Rome intersects with the east–west line between Milan and Venice, giving the city rail access to most of Europe. In addition to regional and local services, the city is served by direct international trains to Zurich, Innsbruck, and Munich. ÖBB nightjet provides overnight sleeper service via Verona on its La Spezia to Wien and München lines.[32]\n\nVerona's main station is Verona Porta Nuova railway station, to the south of the city center. It is considered to be the ninth busiest railway station in Italy, handling approximately 68,000 passengers per day, or 25 million passengers per year.[33]\n\nThere is a lesser station to the east of the city at Porta Vescovo, which used to be the main station in Verona, but now only receives trains between Venice and Porta Nuova.\n\nVerona Airport is located 10 km (6.2 mi) southwest of Verona. It handles around 3 million passengers per year. It is linked to Porta Nuova railway station by a frequent bus service.[33]\n\nThere are direct flights between Verona and Rome Fiumicino, Munich, Berlin, Moscow, Naples, Frankfurt, Catania, London Gatwick, Dublin, Palermo, Cork, Manchester, Liverpool[34] and Cagliari among others.\n• Paolo Bellasio (1554–1594), composer of the Renaissance; member of the Roman School\n• Paolo Caliari (1528–1588), well known as \"Veronese\", painter\n• Gigliola Cinquetti (born 1947), singer who brought Italy its first Eurovision Song Contest win in 1964\n• Damiano Cunego, former world number 1 cyclist and former Giro d'Italia winner\n• Girolamo Fracastoro, also known as Fracastorius, renowned scholar, physician, and poet\n• Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, fictional characters from Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet\n• Sara Simeoni, the former world high jump primatist and Olympic gold medalist\n• Achille Lauro, singer, rapper, and songwriter who represented San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022\n\nTwo of William Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet and The Two Gentlemen of Verona, are set in the city of Verona.[36][37] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare had ever been to the city. In May 2024, Pope Francis regarded Verona as the city of love.[38]\n• Idea Verona, an Italian language, art, and culture school for foreigners visiting or living in VeronaVerona: Authentic Italian Cuisine in the Heart of the Town Authentic Italian Cuisine in the Heart of the Town Authentic Italian Cuisine in the Heart of the Town Authentic Italian Cuisine in the Heart of the TownHome - Verona Area School District: Verona Area High School Graduation will take place on Sunday, June 8th, 2025.

The protagonist makes key decisions that affect the plot, primarily influencing the story and propelling it forward, and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles. If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then each subplot may have its own protagonist.[4]\n\nThe protagonist is the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the antagonist. The antagonist provides obstacles and complications and creates conflicts that test the protagonist, revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist's character, and having the protagonist develop as a result.\n\nThe term protagonist comes from Ancient Greek πρωταγωνιστής (prōtagōnistḗs) 'actor who plays the chief or first part', combined of πρῶτος (prôtos, 'first') and ἀγωνιστής (agōnistḗs, 'actor, competitor'), which stems from ἀγών (agṓn, 'contest') via ἀγωνίζομαι (agōnízomai, 'I contend for a prize').[5]\n\nThe earliest known examples of a protagonist are found in Ancient Greece. At first, dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus. Then in Poetics, Aristotle describes how a poet named Thespis introduced the idea of one actor stepping out and engaging in a dialogue with the chorus. This was the invention of tragedy, and occurred about 536 B.C.[6] Then the poet Aeschylus, in his plays, introduced a second actor, inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters. Sophocles then wrote plays that included a third actor.[7][8][9][10]\n\nA description of the protagonist's origin cited that during the early period of Greek drama, the protagonist served as the author, the director, and the actor and that these roles were only separated and allocated to different individuals later.[11] There is also a claim that the poet did not assign or create the protagonist as well as other terms for actors such as deuteragonist and tritagonist primarily because he only gave actors their appropriate part.[12] However, these actors were assigned their specific areas at the stage with the protagonist always entering from the middle door or that the dwelling of the deuteragonist (second most important character) should be on the right hand, and the tritagonist (third most important character), the left.[12]\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the protagonist is distinguished from the term \"hero\", which was used to refer to a human who became a semi-divine being in the narrative.[10]\n\nIn literary terms, a hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) protagonist is typically admired for their achievements and noble qualities.[13] Heroes are lauded for their strength, courage, virtuousness, and honor, and are considered to be the \"good guys\" of the narrative.[14]\n\nExamples include DC Comics' Superman (hero) and Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games (heroine).\n\nAn antihero (sometimes spelled as anti-hero) or antiheroine is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism, courage, and morality.\n\nExamples include Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye, Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind, Jay Gatsby from The Great Gatsby, and Walter White from Breaking Bad.\n\nA tragic hero is the protagonist of a tragedy.\n\nExamples include Oedipus from Oedipus Rex and Prince Hamlet from Shakespeare's Hamlet.\n\nThe protagonist is not always conventionally good.[15] Contrasting the hero protagonist, a villain protagonist is a protagonist who is a villain, driving the story forward regardless of the evil qualities the main character has. These traits can include being cruel, malicious, and wicked.[16]\n\nExamples include Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita[17] and Richard III in the eponymous play by William Shakespeare.[18]\n\nWhen a supporting protagonist appears, the story is told from the perspective of a character who appears to be minor. This character may be more peripheral from the events of the story and are not as involved within the \"main action\" of the plot. The supporting protagonist may be telling the story while viewing another character as the main influence of the plot.[19]\n\nOne example is Nick in The Great Gatsby.[citation needed]\n\nEuripides' play Hippolytus may be considered to have two protagonists, though one at a time. Phaedra is the protagonist of the first half, who dies partway through the play. Her stepson, the titular Hippolytus, assumes the dominant role in the second half of the play.[20]\n\nIn Henrik Ibsen's play The Master Builder, the protagonist is the architect Halvard Solness. The young woman, Hilda Wangel, whose actions lead to the death of Solness, is the antagonist.[21]\n\nIn Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, Romeo is the protagonist. He is actively in pursuit of his relationship with Juliet, and the audience is invested in that story. Tybalt, as an antagonist, opposes Romeo and attempts to thwart the relationship.[22]\n\nIn Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Prince Hamlet, who seeks revenge for the murder of his father, is the protagonist. The antagonist is the character who most opposes Hamlet, Claudius (though, in many ways, Hamlet is his own antagonist).[23]\n\nSometimes, a work will have a false protagonist, who may seem to be the protagonist, but then may disappear unexpectedly. The character Marion in Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho (1960) is an example.[24]\n\nA novel may contain a number of narratives, each with its own protagonist. Alexander Solzhenitsyn's The First Circle, for example, depicts a variety of characters imprisoned and living in a gulag camp.[25] Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace depicts fifteen major characters involved in or affected by a war.[26]\n\nThough many people equate protagonists with the term hero and possessing heroic qualities, it is not necessary, as even villainous characters can be protagonists. For example Michael Corleone from The Godfather (1972–1990) film series (1978–1983).\n\nIn some cases, the protagonist is not a human: in Richard Adams' novel Watership Down, a group of anthropomorphised rabbits, led by the protagonist Hazel, escape their warren after seeing a vision of its destruction, starting a perilous journey to find a new home.[27]Personalidad ENFJ (Protagonista): Los Protagonistas (ENFJ) se sienten llamados a servir a un propósito mayor en la vida. Reflexivos e idealistas, estos tipos de personalidad se esfuerzan por tener un impacto positivo en otras personas y en el mundo que les rodea. Rara vez rehúyen la oportunidad de hacer lo correcto, aunque no sea nada fácil.\n\nLos Protagonistas son líderes natos, lo que explica que estas personalidades se encuentren entre muchos políticos, entrenadores y profesores notables. Su pasión y carisma les permiten inspirar a los demás, no sólo en sus carreras profesionales, sino en todos los ámbitos de sus vidas, incluidas sus relaciones. Pocas cosas aportan a los Protagonistas una mayor sensación de alegría y satisfacción que guiar a sus amigos y seres queridos para que den lo mejor de sí mismos.\n\nDefender Lo Que Es Justo\n\nLos Protagonistas tienden a expresar sus valores, incluidos la autenticidad y el altruismo. Cuando algo les parece injusto o equivocado, lo denuncian. Pero rara vez dan la impresión de ser impetuosos o prepotentes, ya que su sensibilidad y perspicacia les llevan a hablar de un modo que resuena en los demás.\n\nEste tipo de personalidad tiene una asombrosa capacidad para captar las motivaciones y creencias subyacentes de las personas. A veces, ni siquiera entienden cómo llegan a captar tan rápidamente la mente y el corazón de otra persona. Estos destellos de perspicacia pueden convertir a los Protagonistas en comunicadores increíblemente persuasivos e inspiradores.\n\nCambiar la mentalidad de la gente no es tarea fácil, pero si alguien puede hacerlo, esos son los Protagonistas.\n\nEl arma secreta de los Protagonistas es su pureza de intenciones. En general, están motivados por un deseo sincero de hacer lo correcto más que por el deseo de manipular o tener poder sobre otras personas. Incluso cuando no están de acuerdo con alguien, los Protagonistas buscan puntos en común. El resultado es que las personas con este tipo de personalidad pueden comunicarse con una elocuencia y una sensibilidad que son casi imposibles de ignorar, sobre todo cuando hablan de asuntos que les llegan al corazón.\n\nCuando los Protagonistas se preocupan por alguien, quieren ayudar a resolver los problemas de esa persona, a veces a cualquier precio. La buena noticia es que muchas personas agradecen la ayuda y los consejos de los Protagonistas. Después de todo, hay una razón por la que estas personalidades tienen fama de ayudar a los demás a mejorar sus vidas.\n\nLos Protagonistas son personas auténticas y cariñosas que hablan y actúan. Nada les hace más felices que motivar a otras personas para que hagan lo correcto.\n\nPero involucrarse en los problemas de los demás no siempre es una receta para el éxito. Los Protagonistas suelen tener una visión clara de lo que la gente puede o debe hacer para mejorar, pero no todo el mundo está dispuesto a hacer esos cambios. Si los Protagonistas presionan demasiado, sus seres queridos pueden sentirse resentidos o juzgados injustamente. Y aunque este tipo de personalidad es conocida por su perspicacia, incluso los Protagonistas más sabios pueden a veces malinterpretar una situación o dar un mal consejo sin darse cuenta.\n\nLas personas con este tipo de personalidad son altruistas devotos, dispuestos a enfrentarse a hondas y flechas para defender a las personas y las ideas en las que creen. Esta fuerza de convicción refuerza las habilidades innatas de liderazgo de los Protagonistas, sobre todo su capacidad para guiar a las personas para que trabajen juntas al servicio de un bien mayor.\n\nPero su mayor don puede que sea predicar con el ejemplo. En su vida cotidiana, los Protagonistas revelan cómo situaciones aparentemente ordinarias pueden manejarse con compasión, dedicación y cuidado. Para estas personalidades, incluso las decisiones y acciones cotidianas más insignificantes -desde cómo pasan el fin de semana hasta qué le dicen a un compañero de trabajo que tiene problemas- pueden convertirse en una oportunidad para abrir el camino hacia un futuro mejor.Novella - Wikipedia: A novella is a narrative prose fiction whose length is shorter than most novels, but longer than most novelettes and short stories. The English word novella derives from the Italian novella meaning a short story related to true (or apparently so) facts.\n\nThe Italian term is a feminine of novello, which means new, similarly to the English word news.[1] Merriam-Webster defines a novella as \"a work of fiction intermediate in length and complexity between a short story and a novel\".[1] There is disagreement regarding the number of pages or words necessary for a story to be considered a novella, a short story or a novel.[2] The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association defines a novella's word count to be between 17,500 and 40,000 words;[3][4] at 250 words per page, this equates to 70 to 160 pages. See below for definitions used by other organisations.\n\nThe novella as a literary genre began developing in the Italian literature of the early Renaissance, principally by Giovanni Boccaccio, author of The Decameron (1353).[5] The Decameron featured 100 tales (named novellas) told by ten people (seven women and three men) fleeing the Black Death, by escaping from Florence to the Fiesole hills in 1348. This structure was then imitated by subsequent authors, notably the French queen Marguerite de Navarre, whose Heptaméron (1559) included 72 original French tales and was modeled after the structure of The Decameron.\n\nThe Italian genre novella grew out of a rich tradition of medieval short narrative forms. It took its first major form in the anonymous late 13th century Libro di novelle et di bel parlar gentile, known as Il Novellino, and reached its culmination with The Decameron. Followers of Boccaccio such as Giovanni Fiorentino, Franco Sacchetti, Giovanni Sercambi and Simone de' Prodenzani continued the tradition into the early 15th century. The Italian novella influenced many later writers, including Shakespeare.[6]\n\nNovellas were also written in Spain. Miguel de Cervantes' book Novelas ejemplares (1613) added innovation to the genre with more attention to the depiction of human character and social background.[7]\n\nNot until the late 18th and early 19th centuries did writers fashion the novella into a literary genre structured by precepts and rules, generally in a realistic mode. At that time, the Germans were the most active writers of the novelle (German: \"Novelle\"; plural: \"Novellen\").[7] For the German writer, a novella is a fictional narrative of indeterminate length—a few pages to hundreds—restricted to a single, suspenseful event, situation, or conflict leading to an unexpected turning point (Wendepunkt), provoking a logical but surprising end. Novellen tend to contain a concrete symbol, which is the narrative's focal point.[citation needed]\n\nThe novella influenced the development of the short story and the novel throughout Europe.[8] In the late 19th century Henry James was one of the first English language critics to use the term novella for a story that was longer and more complex than a short story, but shorter than a novel.[7]\n\nIn English speaking countries the modern novella is rarely defined as a distinct literary genre, but is often used as a term for a short novel.[9]\n\nA novella generally features fewer conflicts than a novel, yet more complex conflicts than a short story. The conflicts also have more time to develop than in short stories. Novellas may or may not be divided into chapters (good examples of those with chapters are Animal Farm by George Orwell and The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells), and white space is often used to divide the sections, something less common in short stories. Novellas may be intended to be read at a single sitting, like short stories, and thus produce a unitary effect on the reader.[10] According to Warren Cariou, \"The novella is generally not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is a hallmark of the short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.[11]\n\nThe term novel, borrowed from the Italian novella, originally meant \"any of a number of tales or stories making up a larger work; a short narrative of this type, a fable\", and was then many times used in the plural,[12] reflecting the usage as in The Decameron and its followers. Usage of the more italianate novella in English seems to be a bit younger.[13] The differentiation of the two terms seems to have occurred only in the 19th century, following the new fashion of the novella in German literature. In 1834, John Lothrop Motley could still speak of \"Tieck's novels (which last are a set of exquisite little tales, novels in the original meaning of the word)\".[14] But when the term novella was used it was already clear that a rather short and witty form was intended: \"The brief Novella has ever been a prodigious favorite with the nation…since the days of Boccaccio.\"[15] In 1902, William Dean Howells wrote: \"Few modern fictions of the novel's dimensions…have the beauty of form many a novella embodies.\"[16]\n\nSometimes, as with other genres, the genre name is mentioned in the title of a single work (compare the Divine Comedy or Goethe's Das Märchen). Austrian writer Stefan Zweig's Die Schachnovelle (1942) (literally, \"The Chess Novella\", but translated in 1944 as The Royal Game) is an example of a title naming its genre. This might be suggestive of the genre's historicization.[citation needed]\n\nCommonly, longer novellas are referred to as novels; Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886)[17] and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899)[18] are sometimes called novels, as are many science fiction works such as H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (1897) and Philip Francis Nowlan's Armageddon 2419 A.D. (1928). Less often, longer works are referred to as novellas. The subjectivity of the parameters of the novella genre is indicative of its shifting and diverse nature as an art form.[citation needed] In her 2010 Open Letters Monthly series, \"A Year With Short Novels\", Ingrid Norton criticizes the tendency to make clear demarcations based purely on a book's length, saying that \"any distinctions that begin with an objective and external quality like size are bound to be misleading.\"[19]\n\nStephen King, in his introduction to Different Seasons, a 1982 collection of four novellas, notes the difficulties of selling a novella in the commercial publishing world, since it does not fit the typical length requirements of either magazine or book publishers.[20] Despite these problems, however, the novella's length provides unique advantages; in the introduction to a novella anthology titled Sailing to Byzantium, Robert Silverberg writes:\n\nIn his essay, \"Briefly, the case for the novella\", Canadian author George Fetherling (who wrote the novella Tales of Two Cities) said that to reduce the novella to nothing more than a short novel is like \"insisting that a pony is a baby horse\".[22]\n\nThe sometimes blurry definition between a novel and a novella can create controversy, as was the case with British writer Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach (2007). The author described it as a novella, but the panel for the Man Booker Prize in 2007 qualified the book as a \"short novel\".[23] Thus, this \"novella\" was shortlisted for an award for best original novel. A similar case is found with a much older work of fiction: The Call of the Wild (1903) by Jack London. This book, by modern standards, is short enough and straightforward enough to qualify as a novella. However, historically, it has been regarded as a novel.[citation needed]\n\nDictionaries define novelette similarly to novella, sometimes identically,[24] sometimes with a disparaging sense of being trivial or sentimental.[25] Some literary awards have a longer \"novella\" and a shorter \"novelette\" category, with a distinction based on word count. Among awards, a range between 17,500 and 40,000 words is commonly used for the novella category, whereas 7,500–17,500 is commonly used for novelettes.[26][27][28] According to The Writer, a novelette is approximately between 7,000 and 20,000 words in length, anything shorter being considered a short story.[29]\n\nThis list contains those novellas that are widely considered to be the best examples of the genre, through their appearance on multiple best-of lists.[30][31][32][33][34][35]\n\nSome literary awards include a \"best novella\" award and sometimes a separate \"best novelette\" award, separately from \"best short story\" or \"best novel\". The distinction between these categories may be entirely by word count.\n• None Fassler, Joe (24 April 2012). \"The Return of the Novella, the Original #Longread\".

A tribute to unmatched excellence.Inferno (Dante) - Wikipedia: Inferno (Italian: [iɱˈfɛrno]; Italian for 'Hell') is the first part of Italian writer Dante Alighieri's 14th-century narrative poem The Divine Comedy, followed by Purgatorio and Paradiso. The Inferno describes the journey of a fictionalised version of Dante himself through Hell, guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil. In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth; it is the \"realm [...] of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or violence, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen\".[1] As an allegory, the Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul toward God, with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin.[2]\n\nThe poem begins on the night of Maundy Thursday on March 24 (or April 7), 1300, shortly before the dawn of Good Friday.[3][4] The narrator, Dante himself, is 35 years old, and thus \"midway in the journey of our life\" (Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita)[5] – half of the biblical lifespan of 70 (Psalm 89:10 in the Vulgate; numbered as Psalm 90:10 in the King James Bible). The poet finds himself lost in a dark wood (selva oscura),[6] astray from the \"straight way\" (diritta via,[7] also translatable as 'right way') of salvation. He sets out to climb directly up a small mountain, but his way is blocked by three beasts he cannot evade: a lonza[8] (usually rendered as 'leopard' or 'leopon'),[9] a leone[10] (lion), and a lupa[11] (she-wolf). The three beasts, taken from Jeremiah 5:6,[12] are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of Hell. According to John Ciardi, these are incontinence (the she-wolf); violence and bestiality (the lion); and fraud and malice (the leopard).[13]\n\nIt is now dawn of Good Friday, April 8, with the sun rising in Aries. The beasts drive him back despairing into the darkness of error, a \"lower place\" (basso loco)[14] where the sun is silent (l sol tace).[15] However, Dante is rescued by a figure who announces that he was born sub Iulio[16] (i.e., in the time of Julius Caesar) and lived under Augustus: it is the shade of the Roman poet Virgil, author of the Aeneid, a Latin epic which also featured a journey through the underworld.\n\nOn the evening of Good Friday, Dante hesitates as he follows Virgil; Virgil explains that he has been sent by Beatrice, the symbol of Divine Love. Beatrice had been moved to aid Dante by the Virgin Mary (symbolic of compassion) and Saint Lucia (symbolic of illuminating Grace). Rachel, symbolic of the contemplative life, also appears in the heavenly scene recounted by Virgil. The two of them then begin their journey to the underworld. Feeling uncertain of his worthiness for the journey, Dante reflects on the paths of Aeneas and Paul, who were granted access to the realms of the afterlife, and doubts his own capability to undertake such a passage (Inf. 2.10-36).\n\nDante passes through the gate of Hell, which bears an inscription ending with the phrase \"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate\",[17] most frequently translated as \"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here\".[nb 1] Dante and his guide hear the anguished screams of the Uncommitted. These are the souls of people who in life took no sides; the opportunists who were for neither good nor evil, but instead were merely concerned with themselves. Among these Dante recognises a figure who made the \"great refusal\", implied to be Pope Celestine V, whose \"cowardice (in selfish terror for his own welfare) served as the door through which so much evil entered the Church\".[18] Mixed with them are outcasts who took no side in the Rebellion of Angels. These souls are forever unclassified; they are neither in Hell nor out of it, but reside on the shores of the Acheron. Naked and futile, they race around through the mist in eternal pursuit of an elusive, wavering banner (symbolic of their pursuit of ever-shifting self-interest) while relentlessly chased by swarms of wasps and hornets, who continually sting them.[19] Loathsome maggots and worms at the sinners' feet drink the putrid mixture of blood, pus, and tears that flows down their bodies, symbolising the sting of their guilty conscience and the repugnance of sin. This may also be seen as a reflection of the spiritual stagnation in which they lived.\n\nAfter passing through the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who does not want to let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole (\"It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed\"),[20] referring to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until they reach the other side.\n\nVirgil proceeds to guide Dante through the nine circles of Hell. The circles are concentric, representing a gradual increase in wickedness, and culminating at the centre of the earth, where Satan is held in bondage. The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes: each punishment is a contrapasso, a symbolic instance of poetic justice. For example, later in the poem, Dante and Virgil encounter fortune-tellers who must walk forward with their heads on backward, unable to see what is ahead, because they tried to see the future through forbidden means. Such a contrapasso \"functions not merely as a form of divine revenge, but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny freely chosen by each soul during his or her life\".[21] People who sinned, but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in Hell but in Purgatory, where they labour to become free of their sins. Those in Hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant.\n\nDante's Hell is structurally based on the ideas of Aristotle, but with \"certain Christian symbolisms, exceptions, and misconstructions of Aristotle's text\",[22] and a further supplement from Cicero's De Officiis.[23] Virgil reminds Dante (the character) of \"Those pages where the Ethics tells of three / Conditions contrary to Heaven's will and rule / Incontinence, vice, and brute bestiality\".[24] Cicero, for his part, had divided sins between violence and fraud.[25] By conflating Cicero's violence with Aristotle's bestiality, and his fraud with malice or vice, Dante the poet obtained three major categories of sin, as symbolized by the three beasts that Dante encounters in Canto I: these are Incontinence, Violence/Bestiality, and Fraud/Malice.[22][26] Sinners punished for incontinence (also known as wantonness) – the lustful, the gluttonous, the hoarders and wasters, and the wrathful and sullen – all demonstrated weakness in controlling their appetites, desires, and natural urges; according to Aristotle's Ethics, incontinence is less condemnable than malice or bestiality, and therefore these sinners are located in four circles of Upper Hell (Circles 2–5). These sinners endure lesser torments than do those consigned to Lower Hell, located within the walls of the City of Dis, for committing acts of violence and fraud – the latter of which involves, as Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"abuse of the specifically human faculty of reason\".[26] The deeper levels are organised into one circle for violence (Circle 7) and two circles for fraud (Circles 8 and 9). As a Christian, Dante adds Circle 1 (Limbo) to Upper Hell and Circle 6 (Heresy) to Lower Hell, making 9 Circles in total; incorporating the Vestibule of the Futile, this leads to Hell containing 10 main divisions.[26] This \"9+1=10\" structure is also found within the Purgatorio and Paradiso. Lower Hell is further subdivided: Circle 7 (Violence) is divided into three rings, Circle 8 (Fraud) is divided into ten bolge, and Circle 9 (Treachery) is divided into four regions. Thus, Hell contains 24 divisions in total.\n\nDante awakens to find that he has crossed the Acheron, and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss, Limbo, where Virgil himself resides. The first circle contains the unbaptised and the virtuous pagans, who, although not sinful enough to warrant damnation, did not accept Christ. Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice. They could not, that is, choose Christ; they could, and did, choose human virtue, and for that they have their reward.\"[27] Limbo shares many characteristics with the Asphodel Meadows, and thus, the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven. Without baptism (\"the portal of the faith that you embrace\")[28] they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive. When Dante asked if anyone has ever left Limbo, Virgil states that he saw Jesus (\"a Mighty One\") descend into Limbo and take Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, Rachel, and others (see Limbo of the Patriarchs) into his all-forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved. The event, known as the Harrowing of Hell, supposedly occurred around AD 33 or 34.\n\nDante encounters the poets Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, who include him in their number and make him \"sixth in that high company\".[29] They reach the base of a great Castle – the dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity – surrounded by seven gates, and a flowing brook. After passing through the seven gates, the group comes to an exquisite green meadow and Dante encounters the inhabitants of the Citadel. These include figures associated with the Trojans and their descendants (the Romans): Electra (mother of Troy's founder Dardanus), Hector, Aeneas, Julius Caesar in his role as Roman general (\"in his armor, falcon-eyed\"),[30] Camilla, Penthesilea (Queen of the Amazons), King Latinus and his daughter, Lavinia, Lucius Junius Brutus (who overthrew Tarquin to found the Roman Republic), Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia Africana. Dante also sees Saladin, a Muslim military leader known for his battle against the Crusaders, as well as his generous, chivalrous, and merciful conduct.\n\nDante next encounters a group of philosophers, including Aristotle with Socrates and Plato at his side, as well as Democritus, \"Diogenes\" (either Diogenes the Cynic or Diogenes of Apollonia), Anaxagoras, Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and \"Zeno\" (either Zeno of Elea or Zeno of Citium). He sees the scientist Dioscorides, the mythical Greek poets Orpheus and Linus, and Roman statesmen Marcus Tullius Cicero and Seneca. Dante sees the Alexandrian geometer Euclid and Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer and geographer, as well as the physicians Hippocrates and Galen. He also encounters Avicenna, a Persian polymath, and Averroes, a medieval Andalusian polymath known for his commentaries on Aristotle's works. Dante and Virgil depart from the four other poets and continue their journey.\n\nAlthough Dante implies that all virtuous non-Christians find themselves here, he later encounters two (Cato of Utica and Statius) in Purgatory and two (Trajan and Ripheus) in Heaven. In Purgatorio XXII, Virgil names several additional inhabitants of Limbo who were not mentioned in the Inferno.[31]\n\nDante and Virgil leave Limbo and enter the Second Circle – the first of the circles of Incontinence – where the punishments of Hell proper begin. It is described as \"a part where no thing gleams\".[32] They find their way hindered by the serpentine Minos, who judges all of those condemned for active, deliberately willed sin to one of the lower circles. At this point in Inferno, every soul is required to confess all of their sins to Minos, after which Minos sentences each soul to its torment by wrapping his tail around himself a number of times corresponding to the circle of Hell to which the soul must go. The role of Minos here is a combination of his classical role as condemner and unjust judge of the underworld and the role of classical Rhadamanthus, interrogator and confessor of the underworld.[33] This mandatory confession makes it so every soul verbalises and sanctions their own ranking amongst the condemned since these confessions are the sole grounds for their placement in hell.[34] Dante is not forced to make this confession; instead, Virgil rebukes Minos, and he and Dante continue on.\n\nIn the second circle of Hell are those overcome by lust. These \"carnal malefactors\"[35] are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason. These souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without rest. This symbolises the power of lust to blow needlessly and aimlessly: \"as the lovers drifted into self-indulgence and were carried away by their passions, so now they drift for ever. The bright, voluptuous sin is now seen as it is – a howling darkness of helpless discomfort.\"[36] Since lust involves mutual indulgence and is not, therefore, completely self-centred, Dante deems it the least heinous of the sins and its punishment is the most benign within Hell proper.[36][37] The \"ruined slope\"[38] in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of Christ.[39]\n\nIn this circle, Dante sees Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Paris, Achilles, Tristan, and many others who were overcome by sexual love during their life. Due to the presence of so many rulers among the lustful, the fifth Canto of Inferno has been called the \"canto of the queens\".[40] Dante comes across Francesca da Rimini, who married the deformed Giovanni Malatesta (also known as \"Gianciotto\") for political purposes but fell in love with his younger brother Paolo Malatesta; the two began to carry on an adulterous affair. Sometime between 1283 and 1286, Giovanni surprised them together in Francesca's bedroom and violently stabbed them both to death. Francesca explains:\n\nFrancesca further reports that she and Paolo yielded to their love when reading the story of the adultery between Lancelot and Guinevere in the Old French romance Lancelot du Lac. Francesca says, \"Galeotto fu 'l libro e chi lo scrisse\".[42] The word Galeotto means 'pander', but is also the Italian term for Gallehaut, who acted as an intermediary between Lancelot and Guinevere, encouraging them on to love. John Ciardi renders line 137 as \"That book, and he who wrote it, was a pander.\"[43] Inspired by Dante, author Giovanni Boccaccio invoked the name Prencipe Galeotto in the alternative title to The Decameron, a 14th-century collection of novellas. Ultimately, Francesca never makes a full confession to Dante. Rather than admit to her and Paolo's sins, the very reasons they reside in this circle of hell, she consistently takes an erroneously passive role in the adulterous affair. The English poet John Keats, in his sonnet \"On a Dream\", imagines what Dante does not write, the point of view of Paolo:\n\nAs he did at the end of Canto III, Dante – overcome by pity and anguish – describes his swoon: \"I fainted, as if I had met my death. / And then I fell as a dead body falls\".[45]\n\nIn the third circle, the gluttonous wallow in a vile, putrid slush produced by a ceaseless, foul, icy rain – \"a great storm of putrefaction\"[46] – as punishment for subjecting their reason to a voracious appetite. Cerberus (described as il gran vermo, literally 'the great worm', line 22), the monstrous three-headed beast of Hell, ravenously guards the gluttons lying in the freezing mire, mauling and flaying them with his claws as they howl like dogs. Virgil obtains safe passage past the monster by filling its three mouths with mud.\n\nDorothy L. Sayers writes that \"the surrender to sin which began with mutual indulgence leads by an imperceptible degradation to solitary self-indulgence\".[47] The gluttons grovel in the mud by themselves, sightless and heedless of their neighbors, symbolising the cold, selfish, and empty sensuality of their lives.[47] Just as lust has revealed its true nature in the winds of the previous circle, here the slush reveals the true nature of sensuality – which includes not only overindulgence in food and drink, but also other kinds of addiction.[48]\n\nIn this circle, Dante converses with a Florentine contemporary identified as Ciacco, which means 'hog'.[49] A character with the same nickname later appears in The Decameron of Giovanni Boccaccio, where his gluttonous behaviour is clearly portrayed.[50] Ciacco speaks to Dante regarding strife in Florence between the \"White\" and \"Black\" Guelphs, which developed after the Guelph/Ghibelline strife ended with the complete defeat of the Ghibellines. In the first of several political prophecies in the Inferno, Ciacco \"predicts\" the expulsion of the White Guelphs (Dante's party) from Florence by the Black Guelphs, aided by Pope Boniface VIII, which marked the start of Dante's long exile from the city. These events occurred in 1302, prior to when the poem was written but in the future at Easter time of 1300, the time in which the poem is set.[49]\n\nThe Fourth Circle is guarded by a figure Dante names as Pluto: this is Plutus, the deity of wealth in classical mythology. Although the two are often conflated, he is a distinct figure from Pluto (Dis), the classical ruler of the underworld.[nb 2] At the start of Canto VII, he menaces Virgil and Dante with the cryptic phrase Pape Satàn, pape Satàn aleppe, but Virgil protects Dante from him.\n\nThose whose attitude toward material goods deviated from the appropriate mean are punished in the fourth circle. They include the avaricious or miserly (including many \"clergymen, and popes and cardinals\"),[51] who hoarded possessions, and the prodigal, who squandered them. The hoarders and spendthrifts joust, using great weights as weapons that they push with their chests:\n\nRelating this sin of incontinence to the two that preceded it (lust and gluttony), Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"Mutual indulgence has already declined into selfish appetite; now, that appetite becomes aware of the incompatible and equally selfish appetites of other people. Indifference becomes mutual antagonism, imaged here by the antagonism between hoarding and squandering.\"[53] The contrast between these two groups leads Virgil to discourse on the nature of Fortune, who raises nations to greatness and later plunges them into poverty, as she shifts, \"those empty goods from nation unto nation, clan to clan\".[54] This speech fills what would otherwise be a gap in the poem, since both groups are so absorbed in their activity that Virgil tells Dante that it would be pointless to try to speak to them – indeed, they have lost their individuality and been rendered \"unrecognizable\".[55]\n\nIn the swampy, stinking waters of the river Styx – the Fifth Circle – the actively wrathful fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime, while the sullen (the passively wrathful) lie beneath the water, withdrawn, \"into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe\".[53] At the surface of the foul Stygian marsh, Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"the active hatreds rend and snarl at one another; at the bottom, the sullen hatreds lie gurgling, unable even to express themselves for the rage that chokes them\".[53] As the last circle of Incontinence, the \"savage self-frustration\" of the Fifth Circle marks the end of \"that which had its tender and romantic beginnings in the dalliance of indulged passion\".[53]\n\nPhlegyas reluctantly transports Dante and Virgil across the Styx in his skiff. On the way they are accosted by Filippo Argenti, a Black Guelph from the prominent Adimari family. Little is known about Argenti, although Giovanni Boccaccio describes an incident in which he lost his temper; early commentators state that Argenti's brother seized some of Dante's property after his exile from Florence.[56] Just as Argenti enabled the seizing of Dante's property, he himself is \"seized\" by all the other wrathful souls.\n\nWhen Dante responds \"In weeping and in grieving, accursed spirit, may you long remain,\"[57] Virgil blesses him with words used to describe Christ himself (Luke 11:27).[58] In a literal sense, this reflects the fact that souls in Hell are eternally fixed in the state they have chosen, but allegorically, it reflects Dante's beginning awareness of his own sin.[59]\n\nIn the distance, Dante perceives high towers that resemble fiery red mosques. Virgil informs him that they are approaching the City of Dis. Dis, itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh, contains Lower Hell within its walls.[60] Dis is one of the names of Pluto, the classical king of the underworld, in addition to being the name of the realm. The walls of Dis are guarded by fallen angels. Virgil is unable to convince them to let Dante and him enter.\n\nDante is threatened by the Furies (consisting of Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone) and Medusa. An angel sent from Heaven secures entry for the poets, opening the gate by touching it with a wand, and rebukes those who opposed Dante. Allegorically, this reveals the fact that the poem is beginning to deal with sins that philosophy and humanism cannot fully understand. Virgil also mentions to Dante how Erichtho sent him to the lowest circle of Hell to bring back a spirit from there.[59]\n\nIn the sixth circle, heretics, such as Epicurus and his followers (who say \"the soul dies with the body\")[61] are trapped in flaming tombs. Dante holds discourse with a pair of Epicurian Florentines in one of the tombs: Farinata degli Uberti, a famous Ghibelline leader (following the Battle of Montaperti in September 1260, Farinata strongly protested the proposed destruction of Florence at the meeting of the victorious Ghibellines; he died in 1264 and was posthumously condemned for heresy in 1283); and Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, a Guelph who was the father of Dante's friend and fellow poet, Guido Cavalcanti. The political affiliation of these two men allows for a further discussion of Florentine politics. In response to a question from Dante about the \"prophecy\" he has received, Farinata explains that what the souls in Hell know of life on earth comes from seeing the future, not from any observation of the present. Consequently, when \"the portal of the future has been shut\",[62] it will no longer be possible for them to know anything. Farinata explains that also crammed within the tomb are Emperor Frederick II, commonly reputed to be an Epicurean, and Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, whom Dante refers to as il Cardinale.\n\nDante reads an inscription on one of the tombs indicating it belongs to Pope Anastasius II – although some modern scholars hold that Dante erred in the verse mentioning Anastasius (\"Anastasio papa guardo, / lo qual trasse Fotin de la via dritta\", lines 8–9), confusing the pope with the Byzantine emperor of the time, Anastasius I.[63][64][65][66] Pausing for a moment before the steep descent to the foul-smelling seventh circle, Virgil explains the geography and rationale of Lower Hell, in which the sins of violence (or bestiality) and fraud (or malice) are punished. In his explanation, Virgil refers to the Nicomachean Ethics and the Physics of Aristotle, with medieval interpretations. Virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth: natural resources (\"Nature\") and human labour and activity (\"Art\"). Usury, to be punished in the next circle, is therefore an offence against both; it is a kind of blasphemy, since it is an act of violence against Art, which is the child of Nature, and Nature derives from God.[67]\n\nVirgil then indicates the time through his unexplained awareness of the stars' positions. The \"Wain\", the Great Bear, now lies in the northwest over Caurus (the northwest wind). The constellation Pisces (the Fish) is just appearing over the horizon: it is the zodiacal sign preceding Aries (the Ram). Canto I notes that the sun is in Aries, and since the twelve zodiac signs rise at two-hour intervals, it must now be about two hours prior to sunrise: 4:00 a.m. on Holy Saturday, April 9.[67][68]\n\nThe Seventh Circle, divided into three rings, houses the Violent. Dante and Virgil descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle, having first to evade the Minotaur (L'infamia di Creti, \"the infamy of Crete\", line 12); at the sight of them, the Minotaur gnaws his flesh. Virgil assures the monster that Dante is not its hated enemy, Theseus. This causes the Minotaur to charge them as Dante and Virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle. Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them: they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of Christ's death (Matthew 27:51),[69] at the time of the Harrowing of Hell. Ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of Upper Hell (the entrance of the Second Circle, Canto V).\n\nProtected by the powers of the boiling rivulet, Dante and Virgil progress across the burning plain. They pass a roving group of Sodomites, and Dante, to his surprise, recognizes Brunetto Latini. Dante addresses Brunetto with deep and sorrowful affection, \"paying him the highest tribute offered to any sinner in the Inferno\",[76] thus refuting suggestions that Dante only placed his enemies in Hell.[77] Dante has great respect for Brunetto and feels spiritual indebtedness to him and his works (\"you taught me how man makes himself eternal; / and while I live, my gratitude for that / must always be apparent in my words\");[78] Brunetto prophesies Dante's bad treatment by the Florentines. He also identifies other sodomites, including Priscian, Francesco d'Accorso, and Bishop Andrea de' Mozzi.\n\nThe Poets begin to hear the waterfall that plunges over the Great Cliff into the Eighth Circle when three shades break from their company and greet them. They are Iacopo Rusticucci, Guido Guerra, and Tegghiaio Aldobrandi – all Florentines much admired by Dante. Rusticucci blames his \"savage wife\" for his torments. The sinners ask for news of Florence, and Dante laments the current state of the city. At the top of the falls, at Virgil's order, Dante removes a cord from about his waist and Virgil drops it over the edge; as if in answer, a large, distorted shape swims up through the filthy air of the abyss.\n\nThe creature is Geryon, the Monster of Fraud; Virgil announces that they must fly down from the cliff on the monster's back. Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers: he does not recognize them, but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck (\"On these their streaming eyes appeared to feast\").[79] The coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent Florentine families; they indicate the presence of Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi, Ciappo Ubriachi, the Paduan Reginaldo degli Scrovegni (who predicts that his fellow Paduan Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani will join him here), and Giovanni di Buiamonte. Dante then rejoins Virgil and, both mounted atop Geryon's back, the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the Eighth Circle: the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious.\n\nGeryon, the winged monster who allows Dante and Virgil to descend a vast cliff to reach the Eighth Circle, was traditionally represented as a giant with three heads and three conjoined bodies.[80] Dante's Geryon, meanwhile, is an image of fraud,[81] combining human, bestial, and reptilian elements: Geryon is a \"monster with the general shape of a wyvern but with the tail of a scorpion, hairy arms, a gaudily-marked reptilian body, and the face of a just and honest man\".[82] The pleasant human face on this grotesque body evokes the insincere fraudster whose intentions \"behind the face\" are all monstrous, cold-blooded, and stinging with poison.\n\nDante now finds himself in the Eighth Circle, called Malebolge (\"Evil ditches\"): the upper half of the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious. The Eighth Circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an amphitheatre around which run a series of ten deep, narrow, concentric ditches or trenches called bolge (singular: bolgia). Within these ditches are punished those guilty of Simple Fraud. From the foot of the Great Cliff to the Well (which forms the neck of the funnel) are large spurs of rock, like umbrella ribs or spokes, which serve as bridges over the ten ditches. Dorothy L. Sayers writes that the Malebolge is \"the image of the City in corruption: the progressive disintegration of every social relationship, personal and public. Sexuality, ecclesiastical and civil office, language, ownership, counsel, authority, psychic influence, and material interdependence – all the media of the community's interchange are perverted and falsified\".[83]\n• 1 – Panderers and seducers: These sinners make two files, one along either bank of the ditch, and march quickly in opposite directions while being whipped by horned demons for eternity. They \"deliberately exploited the passions of others and so drove them to serve their own interests, are themselves driven and scourged\". 83 Dante makes reference to a recent traffic rule developed for the Jubilee year of 1300 in Rome. 83 In the group of panderers, the poets notice Venedico Caccianemico, a Bolognese Black Guelph who sold his own sister Ghisola to the Marchese d'Este. In the group of seducers, Virgil points out Jason, the Greek hero who led the Argonauts to fetch the Golden Fleece from Aeëtes, King of Colchis. He gained the help of the king's daughter, Medea, by seducing and marrying her only to later desert her for Creusa. 83 Jason had previously seduced Hypsipyle when the Argonauts landed at Lemnos on their way to Colchis, but \"abandoned her, alone and pregnant\". 84\n• 2 – Flatterers: These also exploited other people, this time abusing and corrupting language to play upon others' desires and fears. They are steeped in excrement (representative of the false flatteries they told on earth) as they howl and fight amongst themselves. Alessio Interminei of Lucca and Thaïs are seen here. 83\n• 3 – Simoniacs: Dante now forcefully expresses his condemnation of those who committed simony, or the sale of ecclesiastic favours and offices, and therefore made money for themselves out of what belongs to God: \"Rapacious ones, who take the things of God, / that ought to be the brides of Righteousness, / and make them fornicate for gold and silver! / The time has come to let the trumpet sound / for you\". 85 The sinners are placed head-downwards in round, tube-like holes within the rock (debased mockeries of baptismal fonts), with flames burning the soles of their feet. The heat of the fire is proportioned to their guilt. The simile of baptismal fonts gives Dante an incidental opportunity to clear his name of an accusation of malicious damage to the font at the Baptistery of San Giovanni. 86 Simon Magus, who offered gold in exchange for holy power to Saint Peter and after whom the sin is named, is mentioned here (although Dante does not encounter him). One of the sinners, Pope Nicholas III, must serve in the hellish baptism by fire from his death in 1280 until 1303 – the arrival in Hell of Pope Boniface VIII, who will take his predecessor's place in the stone tube until 1314, when he will in turn be replaced by Pope Clement V, a puppet of King Philip IV of France who moved the Holy See to Avignon, ushering in the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377). Dante delivers a denunciation of simoniacal corruption of the Church.\n• 4 – Sorcerers: In the middle of the bridge of the Fourth Bolgia, Dante looks down at the souls of fortune tellers, diviners, astrologers, and other false prophets. The punishment of those who attempted to \"usurp God's prerogative by prying into the future\", 87 is to have their heads twisted around on their bodies; in this horrible contortion of the human form, these sinners are compelled to walk backwards for eternity, blinded by their own tears. John Ciardi writes, \"Thus, those who sought to penetrate the future cannot even see in front of themselves; they attempted to move themselves forward in time, so must they go backwards through all eternity; and as the arts of sorcery are a distortion of God's law, so are their bodies distorted in Hell.\" 88 While referring primarily to attempts to see into the future by forbidden means, this also symbolises the twisted nature of magic in general. 87 Dante weeps in pity, and Virgil rebukes him, saying, \"Here pity only lives when it is dead; / for who can be more impious than he / who links God's judgment to passivity?\" 89 Virgil gives a lengthy explanation of the founding of his native city of Mantua. Among the sinners in this circle are King Amphiaraus (one of the Seven against Thebes; foreseeing his death in the war, he sought to avert it by hiding from battle but died in an earthquake caused by Zeus' thunderbolt when trying to flee) and two Theban soothsayers: Tiresias (in Ovid's Metamorphoses III, 324–331, Tiresias was transformed into a woman upon striking two coupling serpents with his rod; seven years later, he was changed back to a man in an identical encounter) and his daughter Manto. Also in this are Aruns (an Etruscan soothsayer who predicted the Caesar's victory in the Roman civil war in Lucan's Pharsalia I, 585–638), the Greek augur Eurypylus, astrologers Michael Scot (served at Frederick II's court at Palermo) and Guido Bonatti (served the court of Guido da Montefeltro), and Asdente (a shoemaker and soothsayer from Parma). Virgil implies that the moon is now setting over the Pillars of Hercules in the West: the time is just after 6:00 a.m., the dawn of Holy Saturday.\n• 5 – Barrators: Corrupt politicians, who made money by trafficking in public offices (the political analogue of the simoniacs), are immersed in a lake of boiling pitch, which represents the sticky fingers and dark secrets of their corrupt deals. 90 They are guarded by demons called the Malebranche (\"Evil Claws\"), who tear them to pieces with claws and grappling hooks if they catch them above the surface of the pitch. The Poets observe a demon arrive with a grafting Senator of Lucca and throw him into the pitch where the demons set upon him. Virgil secures safe-conduct from the leader of the Malebranche, named Malacoda (\"Evil Tail\"). He informs them that the bridge across the Sixth Bolgia has collapsed (as a result of the earthquake that shook Hell at the death of Christ in 34 AD) but that there is another path further on. He sends a squad of demons led by Barbariccia to escort them safely. Based on details in this Canto (and if Christ's death is taken to have occurred at exactly noon), the time is now 7:00 a.m. of Holy Saturday. 91 nb 4 The demons provide some satirical black comedy – in the last line of Canto XXI, the sign for their march is provided by a fart: \"and he had made a trumpet of his ass\". 93\n\nOne of the grafters, an unidentified Navarrese (identified by early commentators as Ciampolo), is seized by the demons, and Virgil questions him. The sinner speaks of his fellow grafters, Friar Gomita (a corrupt friar in Gallura eventually hanged by Nino Visconti – see Purgatorio VIII – for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape) and Michele Zanche (a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King Enzo of Sardinia). He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers into the hands of the demons, and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch. Alichino and Calcabrina start a brawl in mid-air and fall into the pitch themselves, and Barbariccia organizes a rescue party. Dante and Virgil take advantage of the confusion to slip away.\n• 6 – Hypocrites: The Poets escape the pursuing Malebranche by sliding down the sloping bank of the next pit. Here they find the hypocrites listlessly walking around a narrow track for eternity, weighted down by leaden robes. The robes are brilliantly gilded on the outside and are shaped like a monk's habit – the hypocrite's \"outward appearance shines brightly and passes for holiness, but under that show lies the terrible weight of his deceit\", 94 a falsity that weighs them down and makes spiritual progress impossible for them. 95 Dante speaks with Catalano dei Malavolti and Loderingo degli Andalò, two Bolognese brothers of the Jovial Friars, an order that had acquired a reputation for not living up to its vows and was eventually disbanded by Papal decree. 95 Friar Catalano points out Caiaphas, the High Priest of Israel under Pontius Pilate, who counseled the Pharisees to crucify Jesus for the public good (John 11:49–50). 96 He himself is crucified to the floor of Hell by three large stakes, and in such a position that every passing sinner must walk upon him: he \"must suffer upon his body the weight of all the world's hypocrisy\". 94 The Jovial Friars explain to Virgil how he may climb from the pit; Virgil discovers that Malacoda lied to him about the bridges over the sixth .\n• 7 – Thieves: Dante and Virgil leave the of the Hypocrites by climbing the ruined rocks of a bridge destroyed by the great earthquake, after which they cross the bridge of the seventh to the far side to observe the next chasm. The pit is filled with monstrous reptiles: the shades of thieves are pursued and bitten by snakes and lizards, who curl themselves about the sinners and bind their hands behind their backs. The full horror of the thieves' punishment is revealed gradually: just as they stole other people's substance in life, their very identity becomes subject to theft here. 97 One sinner, who reluctantly identifies himself as Vanni Fucci, is bitten by a serpent at the jugular vein, bursts into flames, and is re-formed from the ashes like a phoenix. Vanni tells a dark prophecy against Dante.\n\nVanni hurls an obscenity at God and the serpents swarm over him. The centaur Cacus arrives to punish him; he has a fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back. (In Roman mythology, Cacus, the monstrous, fire-breathing son of Vulcan, was killed by Hercules for raiding the hero's cattle; in Aeneid VIII, 193–267, Virgil did not describe him as a centaur). Dante then meets five noble thieves of Florence and observes their various transformations. Agnello Brunelleschi, in human form, is merged with the six-legged serpent that is Cianfa Donati. A figure named Buoso (perhaps either Buoso degli Abati or Buoso Donati, the latter of whom is mentioned in Inferno XXX.44) first appears as a man, but exchanges forms with Francesco de' Cavalcanti, who bites Buoso in the form of a four-footed serpent. Puccio Sciancato remains unchanged for the time being.\n• 8 – Counsellors of Fraud: Dante addresses a passionate lament to Florence before turning to the next . Here, fraudulent advisers or evil counsellors move about, hidden from view inside individual flames. These are not people who gave false advice, but people who used their position to advise others to engage in fraud. Ulysses and Diomedes are punished together within a great double-headed flame; they are condemned for the stratagem of the Trojan Horse (resulting in the Fall of Troy), for persuading Achilles to sail for Troy (causing Deidamia to die of grief), and for the theft of the sacred statue of Pallas, the Palladium (upon which, it was believed, the fate of Troy depended). Ulysses, the figure in the larger horn of the flame, narrates the tale of his last voyage and death, a creation of Dante's that illustrates the extent of his own pride despite his condemnation of this principal vice throughout the Divine Comedy. 98 Ulysses tells how, after his detainment by Circe, his love for neither his son, his father, nor his wife could overpower his desire to set out on the open sea to \"gain experience of the world / and of the vices and the worth of men\". As they approach the Pillars of Hercules, Ulysses urges his crew:\n\nDante is approached by Guido da Montefeltro, head of the Ghibellines of Romagna, asking for news of his country. Dante replies with a tragic summary of the current state of the cities of Romagna. Guido then recounts his life: he advised Pope Boniface VIII to offer a false amnesty to the Colonna family, who, in 1297, had walled themselves inside the castle of Palestrina in the Lateran. When the Colonna accepted the terms and left the castle, the Pope razed it to the ground and left them without a refuge. Guido describes how St. Francis, founder of the Franciscan order, came to take his soul to Heaven, only to have a demon assert prior claim. Although Boniface had absolved Guido in advance for his evil advice, the demon points out the invalidity: absolution requires contrition, and a man cannot be contrite for a sin at the same time that he is intending to commit it.[100]\n• 9 – Sowers of Discord: In the ninth , the Sowers of Discord are hacked and mutilated for all eternity by a large demon wielding a bloody sword; their bodies are divided as, in life, their sin was to tear apart what God had intended to be united; 101 these are the sinners who are \"ready to rip up the whole fabric of society to gratify a sectional egotism\". 102 The souls must drag their ruined bodies around the ditch, their wounds healing in the course of the circuit, only to have the demon tear them apart anew. These are divided into three categories:\n• Religious schism and discord: Chief among this category is Muhammad, the founder of Islam: his body is ripped from groin to chin, with his entrails hanging out. Dante apparently saw Muhammad as causing a schism within Christianity when he and his followers splintered off. 102 103 Dante also condemns Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, for schism between Sunni and Shiite: his face is cleft from top to bottom. Muhammad tells Dante to warn the schismatic and heretic Fra Dolcino.\n• Civil strife and political discord: In this category are Pier da Medicina (his throat slit, nose slashed off as far as the eyebrows, a wound where one of his ears had been), the Roman tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio (who advised Caesar to cross the Rubicon and thus begin the Civil War; his tongue is cut off), and Mosca dei Lamberti (who incited the Amidei family to kill Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti, resulting in conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines; his arms are hacked off).\n• Family disunion, or discord between kinsmen: Finally, in the third category of sinner, Dante sees Bertran de Born (1140–1215). The knight carries his severed head by its own hair, swinging it like a lantern. Bertran is said to have caused a quarrel between Henry II of England and his son Prince Henry the Young King; his punishment in Hell is decapitation, since dividing father and son is like severing the head from the body. 102\n• 10 – Falsifiers: The final of the Eighth Circle is home to various sorts of falsifiers. A \"disease\" on society, they are themselves afflicted with different types of afflictions: 104 horrible diseases, stench, thirst, filth, darkness, and screaming. Some lie prostrate while others run hungering through the pit, tearing others to pieces. Shortly before their arrival in this pit, Virgil indicates that it is approximately noon of Holy Saturday, and he and Dante discuss one of Dante's kinsmen (Geri de Bello) among the Sowers of Discord in the previous ditch. The first category of falsifiers Dante encounters are the Alchemists (Falsifiers of Things). He speaks with two spirits viciously scrubbing and clawing at their leprous scabs: Griffolino d'Arezzo (an alchemist who extracted money from the foolish Alberto da Siena on the promise of teaching him to fly; Alberto's reputed father the Bishop of Siena had Griffolino burned at the stake) and Capocchio (burned at the stake at Siena in 1293 for practicing alchemy).\n\nSuddenly, two spirits – Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti and Myrrha, both punished as Imposters (Falsifiers of Persons) – run rabid through the pit. Schicchi sinks his teeth into the neck of an alchemist, Capocchio, and drags him away like prey. Griffolino explains how Myrrha disguised herself to commit incest with her father King Cinyras, while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests. Dante then encounters Master Adam of Brescia, one of the Counterfeiters (Falsifiers of Money): for manufacturing Florentine florins of 21 (rather than 24) carat gold, he was burned at the stake in 1281. He is punished by a loathsome dropsy-like disease, which gives him a bloated stomach, prevents him from moving, and an eternal, unbearable thirst. Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the Perjurers (Falsifiers of Words). These are Potiphar's wife (punished for her false accusation of Joseph in Genesis 39:7–19[105]) and Sinon, the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city (Aeneid II, 57–194); Sinon is here rather than in Bolgia 8 because his advice was false as well as evil. Both suffer from a burning fever. Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse, which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil. As a result of his shame and repentance, Dante is forgiven by his guide. Sayers remarks that the descent through Malebolge \"began with the sale of the sexual relationship, and went on to the sale of Church and State; now, the very money is itself corrupted, every affirmation has become perjury, and every identity a lie\"[104] so that every aspect of social interaction has been progressively destroyed.\n\nDante and Virgil approach the Central Well, at the bottom of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants – who perhaps symbolise pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery[106] – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and are visible from the Malebolge.[107] Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; he shouts out the unintelligible Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed had challenged the gods); and Tityos and Typhon, who insulted Jupiter. Also here is Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the poets in his palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell.\n\nAt the base of the well, Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake: Cocytus, the Ninth Circle of Hell. Trapped in the ice, each according to his guilt, are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships. The lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings (or \"rounds\") of traitors corresponding, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of lords. This is in contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery; as Ciardi writes, \"The treacheries of these souls were denials of love (which is God) and of all human warmth. Only the remorseless dead centre of the ice will serve to express their natures. As they denied God's love, so are they furthest removed from the light and warmth of His Sun. As they denied all human ties, so are they bound only by the unyielding ice.\"[108] This final, deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors, betrayers and oathbreakers (its most famous inmate is Judas Iscariot).\n• Round 1 – Caina: this round is named after Cain, who killed his own brother in the first act of murder (Genesis 4:8). 109 This round houses the Traitors to their Kindred: they have their necks and heads out of the ice and are allowed to bow their heads, allowing some protection from the freezing wind. Here Dante sees the brothers Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti, who killed each other over their inheritance and their politics some time between 1282 and 1286. Camiscion de' Pazzi, a Ghibelline who murdered his kinsman Ubertino, identifies several other sinners: Mordred (traitorous son of King Arthur); Vanni de' Cancellieri, nicknamed Focaccia (a White Guelph of Pistoia who killed his cousin, Detto de' Cancellieri); and Sassol Mascheroni of the noble Toschi family of Florence (murdered a relative). Camiscion is aware that, in July 1302, his relative Carlino de' Pazzi would accept a bribe to surrender the Castle of Piantravigne to the Blacks, betraying the Whites. As a traitor to his party, Carlino belongs in Antenora, the next circle down – his greater sin will make Camiscion look virtuous by comparison. 107\n• Round 2 – Antenora: the second round is named after Antenor, a Trojan soldier who betrayed his city to the Greeks. Here lie the Traitors to their Country: those who committed treason against political entities (parties, cities, or countries) have their heads above the ice, but they cannot bend their necks. Dante accidentally kicks the head of Bocca degli Abati, a traitorous Guelph of Florence, and then proceeds to treat him more savagely than any other soul he has thus far met. Also punished in this level are Buoso da Duera (Ghibelline leader bribed by the French to betray Manfred, King of Naples), Tesauro dei Beccheria (a Ghibelline of Pavia; beheaded by the Florentine Guelphs for treason in 1258), Gianni de' Soldanieri (noble Florentine Ghibelline who joined with the Guelphs after Manfred's death in 1266), Ganelon (betrayed the rear guard of Charlemagne to the Muslims at Roncesvalles, according to the French epic poem The Song of Roland), and Tebaldello de' Zambrasi of Faenza (a Ghibelline who turned his city over to the Bolognese Guelphs on Nov. 13, 1280). The Poets then see two heads frozen in one hole, one gnawing the nape of the other's neck. The gnawing sinner tells his story: he is Count Ugolino, and the head he gnaws belongs to Archbishop Ruggieri. In \"the most pathetic and dramatic passage of the Inferno\", 110 Ugolino describes how he conspired with Ruggieri in 1288 to oust his nephew, Nino Visconti, and take control over the Guelphs of Pisa. However, as soon as Nino was gone, the Archbishop, sensing the Guelphs' weakened position, turned on Ugolino and imprisoned him with his sons and grandsons in the Torre dei Gualandi. In March 1289, the Archbishop condemned the prisoners to death by starvation in the tower.\n• Round 3 – Ptolomaea: the third region of Cocytus is named after Ptolemy, who invited his father-in-law Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them (1 Maccabees 16). 111 112 Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied to them. Dante encounters Fra Alberigo, one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes. In 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies (\"before dark Atropos has cut their thread\"). 113 Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michele Zanche (seen in the Eighth Circle, 5), and had him cut to pieces. Branca (that is, his earthly body) did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Zanche's soul arrived at the of the Barrators. Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice (\"And yet I did not open them for him; / and it was courtesy to show him rudeness\"). 114\n• Round 4 – Judecca: the fourth division of Cocytus, named for Judas Iscariot, contains the Traitors to their Lords and benefactors. Upon entry into this round, Virgil says (\"The banners of the King of Hell draw closer\"). 115 Judecca is completely silent: all of the sinners are fully encapsulated in ice, distorted and twisted in every conceivable position. The sinners present an image of utter immobility: it is impossible to talk with any of them, so Dante and Virgil quickly move on to the centre of Hell.\n\nIn the very centre of Hell, condemned for committing the ultimate sin (personal treachery against God), is the Devil, referred to by Virgil as Dis (the Roman god of the underworld; the name \"Dis\" was often used for Pluto in antiquity, such as in Virgil's Aeneid). The arch-traitor, Lucifer was once held by God to be fairest of the angels before his pride led him to rebel against God, resulting in his expulsion from Heaven. Lucifer is a giant, terrifying beast trapped waist-deep in the ice, fixed and suffering. He has three faces, each a different colour: one red (the middle), one a pale yellow (the right), and one black (the left):\n\nDorothy L. Sayers notes that Satan's three faces are thought by some to suggest his control over the three human races: black for the African (the race of Ham), yellow for the Asiatic (the race of Shem), and red for the Europeans (the race of Japheth).[117] All interpretations recognise that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the Trinity: Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate, in contrast to the all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving nature of God.[117] Lucifer retains his six wings but these are now dark, bat-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's wings only further ensures his imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar (44 BC) – an act which, to Dante, represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world.[117] In the central, most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, \"Just as Judas figures treason against God, so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man-in-Society; or we may say that we have here the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world.\"[117]\n\nAt about 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, Virgil and Dante begin their escape from Hell by clambering down Satan's ragged fur, feet-first. When they reach Satan's genitalia, the poets pass through the centre of the universe and of gravity from the Northern Hemisphere of land to the Southern Hemisphere of water. When Virgil changes direction and begins to climb \"upward\" towards the surface of the Earth at the antipodes, Dante, in his confusion, initially believes they are returning to Hell. Virgil indicates that the time is halfway between the canonical hours of Prime (6:00 a.m.) and Terce (9:00 a.m.) — that is, 7:30 a.m. of the same Holy Saturday which was just about to end. Dante is confused as to how, after about an hour and a half of climbing, it is now apparently morning. Virgil explains that it is as a result of passing through the Earth's centre into the Southern Hemisphere, which is twelve hours ahead of Jerusalem, the central city of the Northern Hemisphere (where, therefore, it is currently 7:30 p.m.).\n\nVirgil goes on to explain how the Southern Hemisphere was once covered with dry land, but the land recoiled in horror to the north when Lucifer fell from Heaven and was replaced by the ocean. Meanwhile, the inner rock Lucifer displaced as he plunged into the centre of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the Southern Hemisphere to avoid contact with him, forming the Mountain of Purgatory. This mountain – the only land mass in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere – rises above the surface at a point directly opposite Jerusalem. The poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the \"space contained between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the underside of the earth above,\"[118] moving in opposition to Lethe, the river of oblivion, which flows down from the summit of Mount Purgatory. The poets finally emerge just before dawn on the morning of Easter Sunday (March 27 or April 10, 1300) beneath a sky studded with stars.\n• Dante Dartmouth Project: Full text of more than 70 Italian, Latin, and English commentaries on the Commedia, ranging in date from 1322 (Iacopo Alighieri) to the 2000s (Robert Hollander)\n• World of Dante Multimedia website that offers Italian text of Divine Comedy, Allen Mandelbaum's translation, gallery, interactive maps, timeline, musical recordings, and searchable database for students and teachers by Deborah Parker and IATH (Institute for Advanced Technologies in the Humanities) of the University of Virginia\n• Dante's Divine Comedy: Full text paraphrased in modern English verse by Scottish author and artist Alasdair Gray\n• Audiobooks: Public domain recordings from LibriVox (in Italian, Longfellow translation); some additional recordings\n• A 72-piece art collection featured in Dante's Hell Animated and Inferno by Dante films\n• Danteworlds, multimedia presentation of the Divine Comedy for students by Guy Raffa of the University of Texas\n• Dante's Places: a map (still a prototype) of the places named by Dante in the Commedia, created with GoogleMaps.

The book's solution was challenging but elegant; the film clunky and predictable. \n\n\n\nPity.Inferno (2016 film) - Wikipedia: Inferno is a 2016 American action mystery thriller film directed by Ron Howard and written by David Koepp, loosely based on the 2013 novel of the same name by Dan Brown. It is the sequel to The Da Vinci Code (2006) and Angels & Demons (2009), and is the third and final film in the Robert Langdon film series. It stars Tom Hanks, reprising his role as Robert Langdon, alongside Felicity Jones as Dr. Sienna Brooks, Omar Sy, Sidse Babett Knudsen, Ben Foster, and Irrfan Khan.\n\nFilming began on April 27, 2015, in Venice, Italy, and wrapped on July 21, 2015, in Budapest. The film premiered in Florence on October 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on October 28, 2016, ten years after the release of The Da Vinci Code.[3] The film received negative reviews from critics, and grossed $220 million against a production budget of $75 million.[4][2]\n\nSome time after helping the Holy See dealing with an antimatter threat (as depicted in Angels & Demons), Harvard University professor Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital room in Florence, Italy. He has no memory of the last few days but is plagued with hellish visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks, the doctor tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia as a result of a bullet wound to the head. An orderly says the police are there to question Langdon but the officer turns out to be Vayentha, an assassin, who shoots the orderly while coming up the hallway. Brooks helps Langdon to escape, and they flee to her apartment.\n\nAmong Langdon's personal belongings, Langdon and Brooks find a Faraday pointer, a miniature image projector with a modified version of Sandro Botticelli's Map of Hell, which itself is based on Dante's Inferno. They soon realize this is the first clue in a trail left by Bertrand Zobrist, a dangerously unstable villain who believed that rigorous measures were necessary to reduce the Earth's growing population, and who committed suicide three days earlier after being chased by armed government agents.\n\nLangdon and Brooks figure out that Zobrist, who was obsessed with Dante, has created a biological superweapon he has dubbed \"Inferno\", with the potential of annihilating half the world's population. In the meantime, they have been traced by both Vayentha and government agents, who try to raid the apartment, forcing them to flee again. The government agents are headed by Elizabeth Sinskey, an old lover of Langdon's. Vayentha reports to her employer Harry Sims, the CEO of a private security company called \"The Consortium\", who is acting on behalf of Zobrist, who gives her instructions to kill Langdon as he had become a liability.\n\nLangdon's knowledge of Dante's work and history, and of hidden passages in Florence, allows the two to follow clues such as letters and phrases which lead to various locations in Florence and Venice, while inadvertently killing Vayentha and evading the agents. Along the way, Langdon discovers that he helped a friend of his steal and hide the Dante death mask, a crucial clue, an event that he also does not remember. Zobrist had provided Sims with a video message about the attack, to be broadcast after it has been released. Shocked by its content, Sims allies with Sinskey to prevent the outbreak. However, Langdon and Brooks are contacted by Christoph Bouchard, a man working with Sinskey, warning them that Sinskey is a double agent and is after the Inferno for her own profit. The three cooperate for a while, until Langdon realizes that Bouchard is lying and seeking to profit from Inferno himself, forcing the duo to flee on their own again.\n\nLangdon figures out that the attack is in the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. With that knowledge, Brooks abandons Langdon, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and that she will ensure the release of the weapon. Zobrist and Brooks used to play treasure hunt games; this trail was the backup plan in case something happened to Zobrist. Langdon is recaptured by Bouchard but Sims kills Bouchard and rescues Langdon, who then re-teams with Sinskey, who asked him for help in interpreting the imagery from the Faraday pointer. Sims reveals he was hired by Brooks to kidnap Langdon when Zobrist had been killed, and drugged with benzodiazepine to induce a memory loss; the events in the hospital were all staged.\n\nThey deduce the weapon is in a plastic bag hidden underwater in the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. The agents team – joined by Langdon, Sims, and Sinskey – race to locate and secure the bag, while Brooks and fellow Zobrist disciples attempt to detonate an explosive to rupture the bag and aerosolize the weapon. Sims incapacitates a disciple and kills another but is fatally stabbed by Brooks who, refusing Langdon's pleas, releases the weapon by manually triggering an underwater blast. The detonation ruptures the bag, which however has been trapped by Sinskey in a special containment unit. After struggling against Sinskey and Langdon to open the container, Brooks' last ally is killed by special units. The weapon is secured for analysis, while Langdon and Sinskey ruminate on the idealism of youth and the future of humanity. Langdon returns to Florence and covertly returns the Dante death mask.\n• Tom Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology at Harvard University. 5\n• Omar Sy as Christophe Bouchard, head of the SRS team (Surveillance and Response Support), of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 6\n• Ben Foster as Bertrand Zobrist, a billionaire and transhumanist scientist, intent on solving the world's overpopulation problem. 7 8\n• Sidse Babett Knudsen as Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey, head of the World Health Organization. 6\n• Irrfan Khan as Harry \"The Provost\" Sims, head of The Consortium, helping Zobrist in his mission. 6\n• Ana Ularu as Vayentha, The Consortium's agent in Florence who has orders to follow Langdon. 8\n\nOn July 16, 2013, Columbia Pictures set Ron Howard to direct Dan Brown's fourth novel in the Robert Langdon series, Inferno, with David Koepp writing the script. Imagine Entertainment was set to produce the film, while Tom Hanks was again set to reprise his role as Robert Langdon. On August 26, 2014, Sony had finalized the deal with Howard and Hanks, and set the film for April start of production in Italy.[5] Brian Grazer was also set to produce the film with Howard.[5]\n\nOn December 2, Felicity Jones was in early talks to join the film.[10] On February 17, 2015, studio revealed the confirmed cast for the film, including Jones as Dr. Sienna Brooks, Omar Sy as Christoph Bruder, Irrfan Khan as Harry \"The Provost\" Sims, and Sidse Babett Knudsen as Elizabeth Sinskey, head of the World Health Organization.[6] Ben Foster was set for an unspecified villainous role on March 10, 2015, which later revealed to be the role of Bertrand Zobrist.[7]\n\nFilming began on April 27, 2015, in Venice, Italy,[11] and continued in Florence, Italy, starting at the end of April. Outdoor scenes featuring Hanks were filmed near the Palazzo Vecchio and elsewhere in the historic center of the city, starting on May 2, 2015. Some second unit stunts were filmed by Wade Eastwood at an apartment building close to the Ponte Vecchio, in Florence. Low-flying aerial shots of Florence landmarks, its river and bridges were filmed on May 11, 2015.[12] A sequence displayed in an early trailer features a Padova railway station sign; locals of Padova immediately recognized the scene as recreated somewhere else.[13] As of June 5, 2015, most of the film was planned to be shot in Budapest, Hungary, at Korda Studios.[14] Filming wrapped on July 21, 2015.[15]\n\nDuring location filming, its production codename was \"Headache\", a reference to a concussion suffered by Langdon early in the story.[12][16]\n\nThe score was composed by Hans Zimmer and recorded at Synchron Stage Vienna in Austria.[17]\n\nIn July 2013, Sony set the film for a release on December 18, 2015. However, due to the date clash with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the release date was moved to October 14, 2016.[19] In early 2016, the release date was pushed back two more weeks to October 28, 2016.[20]\n\nOn May 9, 2016, Sony Pictures released the first teaser trailer for the film.[21] The film premiered in Florence, Italy on October 8, 2016, at the New Opera Theater[22] and also held a premiere in India on October 13, 2016, due to the popularity of actor Irrfan Khan.[23]\n\nInferno grossed $34.3 million in the United States and Canada and $185.7 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $220 million, against a production budget of $75 million.[2]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Inferno was initially expected to top the box office with around $25 million from 3,546 theaters in its opening weekend.[24][25] It made $800,000 from Thursday night previews and $5.6 million on its first day, lowering weekend projections to $15 million. It ended up opening to $14.9 million, finishing second at the box office behind Boo! A Madea Halloween and marked the fourth straight domestic disappointment for director Ron Howard.[26]\n\nInternationally, the film was released two weeks ahead of its North American debut, across 53 overseas markets (about 66% of its total international market) in order to avoid competition from Disney/Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange. It finished at first place at the box office in 45 of those countries. In total, it opened to $49.7 million, of which $2.6 million came from IMAX theaters, the second biggest amount of October.[27][28] It fell 49% in its second weekend, earning $28.9 million from 58 markets and was surpassed by Jack Reacher: Never Go Back at the chart.[29] Italy, where the film was partly shot, delivered the biggest opening with $5 million. This was followed by Germany ($4.4 million), where it competed for No. 1 with the animated Finding Dory. Russia similarly opened to $4.4 million, followed by the United Kingdom and Ireland ($3.8 million), Spain ($2 million) and the Netherlands ($1.2 million).[27] Inferno's £2.97 million debut in the U.K. is considerably less than the first (£9.50 million) and the second film (£6.05 million).[30] In Latin America, the film debuted in first in all 11 markets, earning a combined $9 million. Brazil led with $4 million, followed by Mexico ($2.6 million).[27] Similarly in South East Asia, it saw top openings in six out of seven markets for a combined $6 million. Japan ($3.3 million), Taiwan ($1.7 million), India ($1.9 million) and Indonesia ($1 million) posted the biggest debuts.[27] In China, it opened at number one with $13.3 million.[31] In the Oceania region, Australia launched with $1.8 million. Inferno opened to number one across the Middle East for a regional total of $1.8 million.[27] The film opened in France on November 9 and grossed $24.3 million on its opening weekend.[32]\n\nInferno received generally negative reviews from critics.[33] On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, the film has an approval rating of 23% based on 253 reviews; the average rating is 4.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Senselessly frantic and altogether shallow, Inferno sends the Robert Langdon trilogy spiraling to a convoluted new low.\"[34] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 42 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[35] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[36]\n\nBritish film critic Mark Kermode gave the film a negative review, calling it, \"intergalactically stupid\".[37] Cinema Blend wrote Inferno is \"insufferable. And while you're obviously meant to take Inferno with a dash of salt, it's so preposterously stupid and dumb that this rancid popcorn flick becomes increasingly nauseating the further you taste.\"[38]\n• Dante Alighieri and the Divine Comedy in popular cultureDan Brown: Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 bestselling novels, including The Da Vinci Code, which has become one of the best selling novels of all time as well as the subject of intellectual debate among readers and scholars. Brown’s novels are published in 56 languages around the world with over 200 million copies in print.\n\nIn 2005, Brown was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine, whose editors credited him with “keeping the publishing industry afloat; renewed interest in Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history; spiking tourism to Paris and Rome; a growing membership in secret societies; the ire of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel and seven guides to read along with it; a flood of historical thrillers; and a major motion picture franchise.”\n\nThe son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination with the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. These themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books. He is a graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full time to writing. He lives in New England with his yellow lab, Winston.\n\nBrown’s latest novel, Origin, explores two of the fundamental questions of humankind: Where do we come from? Where are we going?Dan Brown - Wikipedia: Daniel Gerhard Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author best known for his thriller novels, including the Robert Langdon novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), Inferno (2013), and Origin (2017). His novels are treasure hunts that usually take place over a period of 24 hours.[3] They feature recurring themes of cryptography, art, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 57 languages and, as of 2012, have sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code, and Inferno, have been adapted into films, while one of them, The Lost Symbol, was adapted into a television series.\n\nThe Robert Langdon novels are deeply engaged with Christian themes and historical fiction, and have generated controversy as a result. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian and he is on a \"constant spiritual journey\" himself.[4] He states that his book The Da Vinci Code is \"an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate\" and suggests that the book may be used \"as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith.\"[5]\n\nDaniel Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire.[6] He has a younger sister, Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1974). Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade.[7] He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks[8] from 1968 until his retirement in 1997.[9] His mother, Constance (née Gerhard), descended from Pennsylvania Dutch Schwenkfelders,[10] and trained as a church organist and student of sacred music.[7] Brown was raised an Episcopalian,[8] and described his religious evolution in a 2009 interview:\n\nWhen asked in the same interview about his then-current religious views, Brown replied:\n\nBrown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household as a child, where codes and ciphers were the linchpin tying together the mathematics, music, and languages in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working out anagrams and crossword puzzles, and he and his siblings participated in elaborate treasure hunts devised by their father on birthdays and holidays. On Christmas, for example, Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the tree, but followed a treasure map with codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to find the gifts.[11] Brown's relationship with his father inspired that of Sophie Neveu and Jacques Saunière in The Da Vinci Code, and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts.[12]\n\nAfter graduating from Phillips Exeter, Brown attended Amherst College where he double majored in English and Spanish. At Amherst, he was initiated into the Psi Upsilon fraternity. He played squash, sang in the Amherst Glee Club, and was a writing student of visiting novelist Alan Lelchuk. Brown spent the 1985 school year in Seville, Spain, where he was enrolled in an art history course at the University of Seville.[11] Brown graduated from Amherst in 1986.[13][14]\n\nAfter graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a collection of tracks such as \"Happy Frogs\" and \"Suzuki Elephants\"; it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled Perspective, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School.[15][16]\n\nBrown joined the National Academy of Songwriters and participated in many of its events. It was there that he met his wife, Blythe Newlon, who was the academy's Director of Artist Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire.[17] In 1994, Brown released a CD titled Angels & Demons. Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for the novel Angels & Demons. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her \"for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist\".[17] The CD included songs such as \"Here in These Fields\" and the religious ballad, \"All I Believe\".[18]\n\nBrown and his wife Blythe moved to Rye, New Hampshire, in 1993.[17] Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at Lincoln Akerman School, a small school for K–8th grade with about 250 students, in Hampton Falls.[19] Brown has written a symphonic work titled Wild Symphony which is supplemented by a book of the same name.[20] The book is illustrated by Hungarian artist Susan Batori[21] which feature simple ambigrams for children, while the visuals trigger the corresponding music in an accompanying app.[22] The music was recorded by the Zagreb Festival Orchestra[23] and will receive its world concert premiere by the Portsmouth Symphony Orchestra in 2020.[24] On March 30, 2022, it was announced that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Weed Road Pictures will turn Wild Symphony into an animated musical feature film in the vein of Walt Disney's Fantasia, with Brown writing the screenplay and songs, and Akiva Goldsman producing.[25]\n\nWhile on vacation in Tahiti in 1993,[11] Brown read Sidney Sheldon's novel The Doomsday Conspiracy, and was inspired to become a writer of thrillers.[11][26][27] He started work on Digital Fortress, setting much of it in Seville, where he had studied in 1985. He also co-wrote a humor book with his wife, 187 Men to Avoid: A Survival Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman, under the pseudonym \"Danielle Brown\".[28] The book's author profile reads, \"Danielle Brown currently lives in New England: teaching school, writing books, and avoiding men.\" The copyright to the book is attributed to Brown.[29]\n\nIn 1996, Brown quit teaching to become a full-time writer. Digital Fortress was published in 1998. His wife Blythe did much of the book's promotion, writing press releases, booking Brown on talk shows, and setting up press interviews. A few months later, Brown and his wife released The Bald Book, another humor book. It was officially credited to his wife, though a representative of the publisher said that it was primarily written by Brown. Brown subsequently wrote Angels & Demons and Deception Point, released in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the former of which was the first to feature the lead character, Harvard symbology expert Robert Langdon.[30]\n\nBrown's first three novels had little success, with fewer than 10,000 copies in each of their first printings. His fourth novel, The Da Vinci Code, became a bestseller, going to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list during its first week of release in 2003. It is one of the most popular books of all time, with 81 million copies sold worldwide as of 2009.[31][32] Its success has helped push sales of Brown's earlier books. In 2004, all four of his novels were on the New York Times list in the same week,[33] and in 2005 he made Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People of the Year. Forbes magazine placed Brown at No. 12 on their 2005 \"Celebrity 100\" list, and estimated his annual income at US$76.5 million. According to the article published in The Times, the estimated income of Brown after Da Vinci Code sales is $250 million.[34]\n\nBrown's third novel featuring Robert Langdon, The Lost Symbol, was released on September 15, 2009.[35] According to the publisher, on its first day the book sold over one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the US, the UK and Canada, prompting the printing of 600,000 hardcover copies in addition to the five million first printing.[36] The story takes place in Washington D.C. over a period of twelve hours, and features the Freemasons. The book also includes many elements that made The Da Vinci Code a number one best seller. Brown's promotional website states that puzzles hidden in the book jacket of The Da Vinci Code, including two references to the Kryptos sculpture at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, give hints about the sequel. Brown has adopted a relevant theme in some of his earlier work.[37]\n\nBrown's fourth novel featuring Robert Langdon, Inferno is a mystery thriller novel released on May 14, 2013, by Doubleday.[38] It ranked No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list for the first 11 weeks of its release, has sold more than 1.4 million copies in the US alone.[39] In a 2006 interview, Brown stated that he had ideas for about 12 future books featuring Robert Langdon.[40] Characters in Brown's books are often named after real people in his life. Robert Langdon is named after John Langdon, the artist who created the ambigrams used for the Angels & Demons CD and novel. Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is named after On a Claire Day cartoonist friend Carla Ventresca. In the Vatican archives, Langdon recalls a wedding of two people named Dick and Connie, which are the names of his parents. Robert Langdon's editor Jonas Faukman is named after Brown's real life editor Jason Kaufman. Brown also said that characters were based on a New Hampshire librarian, and a French teacher at Exeter, André Vernet. Cardinal Aldo Baggia, in Angels & Demons, is named after Aldo Baggia, instructor of modern languages at Phillips Exeter Academy.[41]\n\nIn interviews, Brown has said his wife, Blythe, is an art historian and painter. When they met, she was the Director of Artistic Development at the National Academy for Songwriters in Los Angeles. During the 2006 lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement in The Da Vinci Code, information was introduced at trial that showed that Blythe did research for the book.[42] In one article, she was described as \"chief researcher\".[43] Doubleday published his seventh book, Origin, on October 3, 2017. It is the fifth book in his Robert Langdon series.[44]\n\nBrown's prose style has been criticized as clumsy,[45][46] with The Da Vinci Code being described as \"committing style and word choice blunders in almost every paragraph\".[47] In his 2005 documentary for Channel 4, The Real Da Vinci Code, author and presenter Tony Robinson criticised both the accuracy of the author's historic research and the writing itself, considering the book to be not particularly well written. Much of the criticism was centered on Brown's claim in his preface that the novel is based on fact in relation to Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, and that \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in [the] novel are accurate\".[48][49]\n\nIn addition to Sidney Sheldon, Brown has been quite vocal about a number of other literary influences who have inspired his writing. Recurring elements that Brown prefers to incorporate into his novels include a simple hero pulled out of their familiar setting and thrust into a new one with which they are unfamiliar, an attractive female sidekick/ love interest, foreign travel, imminent danger from a pursuing villain, antagonists who have a disability or genetic disorder, and a 24-hour time frame in which the story takes place.[3]\n\nBrown's work is heavily influenced by academic Joseph Campbell, who wrote extensively on mythology and religion and was highly influential in the field of screenwriting. Brown also states he based the character of Robert Langdon on Campbell.[50] Director Alfred Hitchcock appears to be another key influence on Brown. Like Hitchcock, the writer favors suspense-laden plots involving an innocent middle-aged man pursued by deadly foes, glamorous foreign settings, key scenes set in tourist destinations, a cast of wealthy and eccentric characters, young and curvaceous female sidekicks, Catholicism and MacGuffins. Brown does his writing in his loft. He told fans that he uses inversion therapy to help with writer's block. He uses gravity boots and says, \"hanging upside down seems to help me solve plot challenges by shifting my entire perspective\".[51]\n\nIn August 2005 author Lewis Perdue unsuccessfully sued Brown for plagiarism, on the basis of claimed similarity between The Da Vinci Code and his novels, The Da Vinci Legacy (1983) and Daughter of God (2000). Judge George B. Daniels said, in part: \"A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that The Da Vinci Code is substantially similar to Daughter of God.\"[52] In April 2006 Brown's publisher, Random House, won a copyright infringement case brought by authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, who claimed that Brown stole ideas from their 1982 book Holy Blood Holy Grail for his 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code. It was in the book Holy Blood Holy Grail that Baigent, Leigh, and co-author Henry Lincoln had advanced the theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had a child and that the bloodline continues to this day. Brown apparently alluded to the two authors' names in his book. Leigh Teabing, a lead character in both the novel and the film, uses Leigh's name as the first name, and anagrammatically derives his last name from Baigent's. Mr Justice Peter Smith found in Brown's favor in the case, and as a private amusement, embedded his own Smithy code in the written judgment.[53]\n\nOn March 28, 2007, Brown's publisher, Random House, won an appeal copyright infringement case. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the efforts from Baigent and Leigh, who became liable for paying legal expenses of nearly US$6 million.[54] Brown has been sued twice in U.S. federal courts by the author Jack Dunn, who claims Brown copied a huge part of his book The Vatican Boys to write The Da Vinci Code (2006–07) and Angels & Demons (2011–12). Both lawsuits were not allowed to go to a jury trial and Jack Dunn claims the judge in both cases benefited from his decisions by becoming an author published and supported by people associated with Random House, Dan Brown's publisher. In 2017, in London, another claim was begun against Brown by Jack Dunn who claimed that justice was not served in the U.S. lawsuits.[55]\n\nIn October 2004, Brown and his siblings donated US$2.2 million to Phillips Exeter Academy in honor of their father, to set up the Richard G. Brown Technology Endowment to help \"provide computers and high-tech equipment for students in need\".[56] On April 14, 2011, Dan and his wife, Blythe Newlon Brown, created an eponymous scholarship fund to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his graduation from Amherst College. It is a permanently endowed scholarship fund that provides financial aid to students at Amherst, with preference given to incoming students with an interest in writing.[14] On June 16, 2016, Brown donated US$337,000 to the Ritman Library in Amsterdam to digitize a collection of ancient books.[57]\n\nBrown and his wife, Blythe Newlon, were supporters of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation.[58][17] In 2019, after 21 years of marriage, Brown and his wife acrimoniously divorced, with the financial settlement still to be concluded due to Brown's alleged infidelities during the latter part of their marriage.[59] In December 2021, the couple agreed to settle the lawsuit.[60]\n\nIn 2006, Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code was released as a film by Columbia Pictures, with director Ron Howard. It was widely anticipated and launched the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, though it received overall poor reviews. It currently has a 26% rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, derived from 165 negative reviews of the 214 counted.[62] It was later listed as one of the worst films of 2006 on Ebert & Roeper,[63] but also the second highest-grossing film of the year, pulling in US$750 million worldwide.[64]\n\nBrown was listed as one of the executive producers of the film The Da Vinci Code, and also created additional codes for the film. One of his songs, \"Phiano\", which Brown wrote and performed, was listed as part of the film's soundtrack. In the film, Brown and his wife can be seen in the background of one of the early book signing scenes.[65] The next film, Angels & Demons, was released on May 15, 2009, with Howard and Hanks returning. It, too, garnered mostly negative reviews, though critics were kinder to it than to its predecessor; it has a 37% meta-rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[66]\n\nFilmmakers expressed interest in adapting The Lost Symbol into a film as well.[67][68] The screenplay was written by Danny Strong, with pre-production expected to begin in 2013.[69] According to a January 2013 article in Los Angeles Times the final draft of the screenplay was due sometime in February.[69] In July 2013, Sony Pictures announced they would instead adapt Inferno for a release date of October 14, 2016,[70] with Ron Howard as director, David Koepp adapting the screenplay and Tom Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon. Inferno was released on October 28, 2016.[71]\n\nImagine Entertainment was announced in 2014 to produce a television series based on Digital Fortress, written by Josh Goldin and Rachel Abramowitz.[72] In 2021, Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol was adapted into a television series repositioned as an origin story for Brown's Robert Langdon character with Ashley Zukerman playing Langdon.[73] It ran on the streaming service Peacock for one season.[74]"}

(medio siglo antes que Kamala Harris)Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Monrovia, 29 de octubre de 1938) es una economista y política liberiana. Fue la 24.ª presidenta de Liberia, tras vencer en las elecciones presidenciales del 8 de noviembre de 2005, cuando derrotó al otro principal candidato, el exfutbolista George Weah. Tomó posesión de su cargo el 16 de enero de 2006, siendo la primera mujer presidente electa en África,[2]​ cargo que ocupó hasta 2018.\n\nSirvió como ministra de Hacienda bajo el mandato del presidente William Tolbert, desde 1972 hasta 1973, cuando un golpe de Estado derrocó a Tolbert, después de lo cual dejó Liberia y ocupó altos cargos en diversas instituciones financieras. Obtuvo un distante segundo lugar en las elecciones presidenciales de 1997. El 7 de octubre de 2011 recibió el Premio Nobel de la Paz, compartido con su compatriota Leymah Gbowee y con la yemení Tawakel Karman.\n\nPor parte de su padre es de la etnia gola (1/2) y por parte de su madre de la etnia kru (1/4) y alemana (1/4).\n\nEl padre de Johnson-Sirleaf, Jahmale Carney Johnson, nació en la pobreza de las zonas rurales. Fue el hijo de un jefe Gola de nombre Jenneh, en Julijuah, del condado de Bomi. Su padre fue enviado a Monrovia, donde su apellido fue cambiado a Johnson por la lealtad de su padre al Presidente Hilary R. W. Johnson, el primer presidente que nació en Liberia. El padre de Johnson-Sirleaf se convirtió en el primer liberiano proveniente de un grupo de una etnia indígena en ocupar un cargo de la legislación nacional.\n\nSu madre también nació en la pobreza en Greenville. Su abuela Juah Sarwee envió a la madre de Johnson-Sirleaf a Monrovia cuando el abuelo alemán de Johnson-Sirleaf tuvo que huir del país después que Monrovia le declarara la guerra a Alemania durante la Primera Guerra Mundial. Una miembro de una prominente familia estadounidense-liberiana, Cecilia Dunbar, adoptó y crio a la madre de Johnson-Sirleaf.\n\nAunque no sea américo-liberiana por descendencia, Johnson-Sirleaf se considera culturalmente estadounidense-liberiana.\n\nJohnson-Sirleaf estudió economía y cuentas de 1948 a 1955 en el Colegio de África Occidental en Monrovia. Ella se casó con James Sirleaf cuando tenía diecisiete años de edad, y viajó a América en 1961 para continuar sus estudios en la Universidad de Colorado, donde finalmente obtuvo un grado. Johnson-Sirleaf empezó a estudiar economía en Harvard de 1969 a 1971, ganando un Máster en Administración Pública. A continuación, regresó a su país para trabajar bajo el gobierno de William Tolbert. Sirleaf tuvo cuatro hijos y tiene ocho nietos. Además, su sobrino Emmanuel Sumana Elsar fue su consejero político durante las elecciones presidenciales del 2005 en contra de George Weah.\n\nElla sirvió como ministra de Hacienda de 1972 a 1973 bajo el gobierno de Tolbert. Renunció después de entrar en un desacuerdo sobre gastos. Unos años más tarde, el sargento Samuel Doe, uno de los miembros del grupo étnico indígena krahn, tomó el poder en un golpe militar y el presidente William Tolbert fue ejecutado junto con varios miembros de su gabinete por un pelotón de fusilamiento. La Redención del Pueblo tomó el control del país y encabezó una purga contra el ex gobierno. Johnson-Sirleaf logró escapar en sentido estricto y se exilió en Kenia. De 1983 a 1985 se desempeñó como directora del Banco Citibank en Nairobi. Cuando Samuel Doe se declaró a sí mismo presidente de Liberia, decidió regresar a su país de origen a participar en las elecciones y volverse en contra de Doe. Fue puesta bajo arresto domiciliario por el hecho, y fue condenada a 10 años de prisión. Johnson-Sirleaf estuvo un tiempo mucho más corto por tomar la oferta de volver una vez más al exilio.\n\nSe trasladó a Washington, y sirvió como vicepresidente de la Oficina Regional para el Banco Citibank, en Nairobi, y del Banco del Ecuador, en Washington. De 1992 a 1997 trabajó como asistente de administrador y, a continuación, directora del Desarrollo de las Naciones Unidas del Programa de la Oficina Regional para África. Volvió a Liberia durante los disturbios civiles y se conmovió cuando Samuel Doe fue asesinado por un grupo escindido de Charles Taylor del Frente Patriótico Nacional de Liberia. Inicialmente, ella apoyó a Taylor en la sangrienta rebelión contra el presidente Samuel Doe en 1990, que más tarde pasó a oponerse a él. Un gobierno provisional fue puesto en el poder, liderado por una sucesión. En 1997, ella se postuló para las elecciones presidenciales de 1997, donde obtuvo el segundo lugar en una polémica elección, perdiendo ante Charles Taylor consiguiendo un 10% de los votos ante el 75% de Taylor. Muchos observadores dijeron que la elección fue justa, aunque pronto Johnson-Sirleaf fue acusada de traición.\n\nEn 1999 la Guerra Civil regresó a la región y Taylor fue acusado de interferir con sus vecinos, fomentando los disturbios y la rebelión. El 11 de agosto de 2003, después de mucha persuasión, Charles Taylor entregó el poder a su suplente Moses Blah. El nuevo gobierno provisional y los grupos rebeldes firmaron un histórico acuerdo de paz y establecieron la instalación de un nuevo jefe de Estado. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf se propuso como una posible candidata, pero al final los diversos grupos seleccionaron a Gyude Bryant, un político neutral. Johnson-Sirleaf se desempeñó como jefe de la Comisión para la Reforma de la gobernanza. Johnson-Sirleaf desempeñó un papel activo en el gobierno de transición como el país preparándose para las elecciones de 2005, y, finalmente, postuló para la presidencia en contra de su rival, el exfutbolista internacional, George Weah. Johnson-Sirleaf obtuvo una mayoría en la elección a través de la disputa de Weah en los resultados. El anuncio de la nueva líder se aplazó hasta las investigaciones que se llevaron a cabo.\n\nEn la primera vuelta de las elecciones, su candidatura fue la segunda más votada con 175.520 votos, pasando a la segunda vuelta definitiva en la que se enfrentó a George Weah. El 11 de noviembre de 2005, con un escrutinio del 97% de los votos, la Comisión Electoral Nacional de Liberia declaró a Johnson-Sirleaf ganadora de las elecciones, resultado no aceptado por su oponente George Weah, que presentó un recurso ante el Tribunal Supremo liberiano pidiendo que se suspendiera el escrutinio por supuestas irregularidades. Las acusaciones de fraude fueron rechazadas por los observadores internacionales y por la comisión electoral, que el 23 de noviembre confirmó el triunfo de Johnson-Sirleaf.\n\nEl 23 de noviembre de 2005, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf fue declarada la ganadora de las elecciones en Liberia y se confirmó como la próxima presidenta del país. Su inauguración, a la que asistieron numerosos dignatarios extranjeros, incluida la primera dama de EE. UU. Laura Bush y la secretaria de Estado Condoleezza Rice, tuvo lugar el lunes 16 de enero de 2006.\n\nEn marzo de 2012 se vio envuelta en una fuerte polémica por unas declaraciones en las que defendía la criminalización de la homosexualidad[3]​ en su país en un momento en el que se debatían dos proyectos para endurecer las penas. A causa de ello, el ex primer ministro británico Tony Blair, presente en el acto en el cual Johnson-Sirleaf pronunció esas declaraciones, declaró sentirse avergonzado[4]​ y organizaciones defensoras de los derechos de los homosexuales han comenzado una campaña para que el Premio Nobel le sea retirado.[5]​\n\nEn diciembre de 2021, James Sirleaf, uno de los hijos de Ellen Sirleaf, murió en su residencia de Liberia en circunstancias desconocidas.[6]​[7]​\n\nDurante la campaña electoral, la figura de la abuela fue a menudo eclipsada por parte de los funcionarios y guardaespaldas. Un veterano de la escena política de Liberia le dijo a la señora Johnson-Sirleaf que su apodo proviene de su voluntad de hierro y determinación.\n\n\"Hubiera sido mucho más fácil para ella dejar la política y sentarse en casa, otros lo han hecho pero ella nunca ha renunciado\".\n\nEn la primera ronda de votación de 2005, llegó en segundo lugar con 175.520 votos, a través de su puesta a la segunda vuelta de votación el 8 de noviembre contra el exjugador de fútbol George Weah. El 11 de noviembre, la Comisión Electoral Nacional de Liberia declaró a Johnson-Sirleaf la presidenta electa de Liberia. Su inauguración de su cargo tuvo lugar el 16 de enero del 2006; algunos extranjeros que asistieron a la ceremonia fueron Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush y Michaëlle Jean.\n\nEl 15 de marzo del 2006, la presidenta Johnson-Sirleaf pidió una reunión conjunta del Congreso de los Estados Unidos, pidiendo el apoyo de América para ayudar a su país a \"convertirse en un brillante faro, un ejemplo para África y el mundo de lo que el amor por la libertad puede lograr\".\n\nIncómodamente para Johnson-Sirleaf, los seguidores del expresidente Taylor siguen siendo en gran número en el gobierno de Liberia. La distanciada esposa de Taylor, Jewel Howard Taylor, se encuentra en el Senado.\n\nEl 26 de julio de 2007, la presidenta Johnson-Sirleaf, celebra el Día aniversario 160 de la Independencia de Liberia bajo el lema \"En Liberia 160: Reclamemos el futuro\". Ella le pidió al activista de 25 años de edad, Kimmie Weeks, servir como orador nacional para las celebraciones. Kimmie se convirtió en el orador nacional más joven de Liberia en más de un centenar de años y pronunció un discurso de gran alcance. Pidió que el gobierno le dé prioridad a la educación y a la atención de la salud. Unos días más tarde, la presidenta Sirleaf emitió una orden ejecutiva en la que la educación primaria fue declarada gratuita y obligatoria para todos los niños en edad escolar.\n\nLa presidenta Johnson-Sirleaf es una miembro del Consejo de Mujeres Líderes Mundiales, una red internacional de actuales y exmujeres presidentas y primeras ministras, cuya misión es movilizar el mayor nivel de mujeres dirigentes a nivel mundial para la acción colectiva sobre cuestiones de importancia como un desarrollo equitativo.\n\nEn 2011 fue reconocida con el Premio Nobel de la paz junto a la activista Leymah Gbowee del movimiento Mujeres de Liberia Acción Masiva para la Paz y la periodista, activista y política yemení Tawakel Karman.[8]​\n\nEn el legado de Sirleaf destaca haber logrado una década de paz en Liberia y organizar una transición pacífica tras perder las elecciones en 2017 en segunda vuelta. Sin embargo también ha sido acusada de nepotismo a causa del nombramiento de su hijo Charles Sirleaf como vicegobernador del Banco Central de Liberia o la posición de su otro hijo Robert como presidente de la Compañía Nacional de Petróleo de Liberia –NOCAL-.[9]​\n\nHa recibido críticas por los pocos avances durante su mandato en relación con los derechos de las mujeres y las políticas de igualdad de género. La activista Leymah Gbowee que compartió con Sirleaf el premio Nobel en 2011 señaló \"Si bien rompió el techo de cristal, y hay que reconocerlo, sus políticas no han cambiado problemáticas fundamentales de género” y reprochando las declaraciones de Sirleaf en las que tildaba el feminismo de extremismo.[10]​[9]​\n\nEn 2012 fue criticada por organizaciones de derechos humanos por defender una ley que criminaliza las relaciones homosexuales en Liberia[11]​ señalando en unas declaraciones al periódico The Guardian \"Tenemos ciertos valores tradicionales en nuestra sociedad que nos gustaría conservar\".[12]​[13]​\n• Artículos en Wikinoticias: Toma posesión la primera mujer jefe de estado de un país africano\n• Un artículo sobre Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf por el Museo internacional de mujeres.\n• None Liberia: Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf será la primera mujer jefe de Estado en África enlace roto disponible en Internet Archive ; véase el historial , la primera versión y la última ).

One of the two Marxist–Leninist states in Southeast Asia,[i] Vietnam shares land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west. It shares maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia through the South China Sea. Its capital is Hanoi and its largest city is Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nVietnam was inhabited by the Paleolithic age, with states established in the first millennium BC on the Red River Delta in modern-day northern Vietnam. The Han dynasty annexed Northern and Central Vietnam, which were subsequently under Chinese rule from 111 BC until the first dynasty emerged in 939. Successive monarchical dynasties absorbed Chinese influences through Confucianism and Buddhism, and expanded southward to the Mekong Delta, conquering Champa. During most of the 17th and 18th centuries, Vietnam was effectively divided into two domains of Đàng Trong and Đàng Ngoài. The Nguyễn—the last imperial dynasty—surrendered to France in 1883. In 1887, its territory was integrated into French Indochina as three separate regions. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the nationalist coalition Viet Minh, led by the communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, launched the August Revolution and declared Vietnam's independence from the Empire of Japan in 1945.\n\nVietnam went through prolonged warfare in the 20th century. After World War II, France returned to reclaim colonial power in the First Indochina War, from which Vietnam emerged victorious in 1954. As a result of the treaties signed between the Viet Minh and France, Vietnam was also separated into two parts. The Vietnam War began shortly after, between the communist North Vietnam, supported by the Soviet Union and China, and the anti-communist South Vietnam, supported by the United States. Upon the North Vietnamese victory in 1975, Vietnam reunified as a unitary socialist state under the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in 1976. An ineffective planned economy, a trade embargo by the West, and wars with Cambodia and China crippled the country further. In 1986, the CPV initiated economic and political reforms similar to the Chinese economic reform, transforming the country to a socialist-oriented market economy. The reforms facilitated Vietnamese reintegration into the global economy and politics.\n\nVietnam is a developing country with a lower-middle-income economy. It has high levels of corruption, censorship, environmental issues and a poor human rights record. It is part of international and intergovernmental institutions including the ASEAN, the APEC, the CPTPP, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OIF, and the WTO. It has assumed a seat on the United Nations Security Council twice.\n\nThe name Việt Nam (pronounced [viə̂tˀ nāːm], chữ Hán: 越南), literally \"Viet South\", means \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order or \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order.[15] A variation of the name, Nanyue (or Nam Việt, 南越), was first documented in the 2nd century BC. The term \"Việt\" (Yue) (Chinese: 越; pinyin: Yuè; Cantonese Yale: Yuht; Wade–Giles: Yüeh4; Vietnamese: Việt) in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"戉\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty (c. 1200 BC), and later as \"越\". At that time, it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south.\n\nBetween the 7th and 4th centuries BC, 'Yue'/'Việt' referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people. From the 3rd century BC, the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of southern China and northern Vietnam, with particular ethnic groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, Chinese: 百越; pinyin: Bǎiyuè; Cantonese Yale: Baak Yuet; Vietnamese: Bách Việt; lit. 'Hundred Yue/Viet').\n\nThe term 'Baiyue'/'Bách Việt' first appeared in the book Lüshi Chunqiu compiled around 239 BC. By the 17th and 18th centuries AD, educated Vietnamese apparently referred to themselves as người Việt (Viet people) or người Nam (southern people).\n\nThe form Việt Nam ( 越南) is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem Sấm Trạng Trình. The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in Hải Phòng that dates to 1558. In 1802, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (who later became Emperor Gia Long) established the Nguyễn dynasty. In the second year of his rule, he asked the Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing dynasty to confer on him the title 'King of Nam Việt / Nanyue' (南越 in Chinese character) after seizing power in Annam. The Emperor refused because the name was related to Zhao Tuo's Nanyue, which included the regions of Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China. The Qing Emperor, therefore, decided to call the area \"Việt Nam\" instead,[j] meaning \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order but the Vietnamese understood it as \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order.[15] Between 1804 and 1813, the name Vietnam was used officially by Emperor Gia Long.[j] It was revived in the early 20th century in Phan Bội Châu's History of the Loss of Vietnam, and later by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQDĐ). The country was usually called Annam until 1945, when the imperial government in Huế adopted Việt Nam.\n\nArchaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the Paleolithic age. Stone artefacts excavated in Gia Lai province have been claimed to date to 780,000 years ago,[27] based on associated find of tektites, however this claim has been challenged because tektites are often found in archaeological sites of various ages in Vietnam.[28] Homo erectus fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in Lạng Sơn and Nghệ An provinces in northern Vietnam. The oldest Homo sapiens fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of Middle Pleistocene provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum. Teeth attributed to Homo sapiens from the Late Pleistocene have been found at Dong Can, and from the Early Holocene at Mai Da Dieu, Lang Gao and Lang Cuom. Areas comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research.[39][40][41][42]\n\nBy about 1,000 BC, the development of wet-rice cultivation in the Ma River and Red River floodplains led to the flourishing of Đông Sơn culture, notable for its bronze casting used to make elaborate bronze Đông Sơn drums. At this point, the early Vietnamese kingdoms of Văn Lang and Âu Lạc appeared, and the culture's influence spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Maritime Southeast Asia, throughout the first millennium BC.\n\nAccording to Vietnamese legends, Hồng Bàng dynasty of the Hùng kings first established in 2879 BC is considered the first state in the history of Vietnam (then known as Xích Quỷ and later Văn Lang). In 257 BC, the last Hùng king was defeated by Thục Phán. He consolidated the Lạc Việt and Âu Việt tribes to form the Âu Lạc, proclaiming himself An Dương Vương. In 179 BC, a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo (\"Triệu Đà\") defeated An Dương Vương and consolidated Âu Lạc into Nanyue. However, Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han dynasty in 111 BC after the Han–Nanyue War. For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule. Early independence movements, such as those of the Trưng Sisters and Lady Triệu, were temporarily successful, though the region gained a longer period of independence as Vạn Xuân under the Anterior Lý dynasty between AD 544 and 602.[verification needed] By the early 10th century, Northern Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the Khúc family.\n\nIn AD 938, the Vietnamese lord Ngô Quyền defeated the forces of the Chinese Southern Han state at Bạch Đằng River and achieved full independence for Vietnam in 939 after a millennium of Chinese domination. By the 960s, the dynastic Đại Việt (Great Viet) kingdom was established, Vietnamese society enjoyed a golden era under the Lý and Trần dynasties. During the rule of the Trần dynasty, Đại Việt repelled three Mongol invasions. Meanwhile, the Mahāyāna branch of Buddhism flourished and became the state religion. Following the 1406–7 Ming–Hồ War, which overthrew the Hồ dynasty, Vietnamese independence was interrupted briefly by the Chinese Ming dynasty, but was restored by Lê Lợi, the founder of the Lê dynasty. The Vietnamese polity reached their zenith in the Lê dynasty of the 15th century, especially during the reign of emperor Lê Thánh Tông (1460–1497). Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the Vietnamese polity expanded southward in a gradual process known as Nam tiến (\"Southward expansion\"), eventually conquering the kingdom of Champa and part of the Khmer Kingdom.\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, civil strife and frequent political infighting engulfed much of Đại Việt. First, the Chinese-supported Mạc dynasty challenged the Lê dynasty's power. After the Mạc dynasty was defeated, the Lê dynasty was nominally reinstalled. Actual power, however, was divided between the northern Trịnh lords and the southern Nguyễn lords, who engaged in a civil war for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s. Vietnam was divided into North (Trịnh) and South (Nguyễn) from 1600 to 1777. During this period, the Nguyễn expanded southern Vietnam into the Mekong Delta, annexing the Central Highlands and the Khmer lands in the Mekong Delta. The division of the country ended a century later when the Tây Sơn brothers helped Trịnh to end Nguyễn, they also established new dynasty and ended Trịnh. However, their rule did not last long, and they were defeated by the remnants of the Nguyễn lords, led by Nguyễn Ánh. Nguyễn Ánh unified Vietnam, and established the Nguyễn dynasty, ruling under the name Gia Long.\n\nIn the 1500s, the Portuguese explored the Vietnamese coast and reportedly erected a stele on the Chàm Islands to mark their presence. By 1533, they began landing in the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave because of local turmoil and fighting. They also had less interest in the territory than they did in China and Japan. After they had settled in Macau and Nagasaki to begin the profitable Macau–Japan trade route, the Portuguese began to involve themselves in trade with Hội An. Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries under the Padroado system were active in both Vietnamese realms of Đàng Trong (Cochinchina or Quinan) and Đàng Ngoài (Tonkin) in the 17th century. The Dutch also tried to establish contact with Quinan in 1601 but failed to sustain a presence there after several violent encounters with the locals. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with Tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving Dejima in Japan to establish trade for silk. Meanwhile, in 1613, the first English attempt to establish contact with Hội An failed following a violent incident involving the East India Company. By 1672 the English did establish relations with Tonkin and were allowed to reside in Phố Hiến.\n\nBetween 1615 and 1753, French traders also engaged in trade in Vietnam. The first French missionaries arrived in 1658, under the Portuguese Padroado. From its foundation, the Paris Foreign Missions Society under Propaganda Fide actively sent missionaries to Vietnam, entering Cochinchina first in 1664 and Tonkin first in 1666. Spanish Dominicans joined the Tonkin mission in 1676, and Franciscans were in Cochinchina from 1719 to 1834. The Vietnamese authorities began[when?] to feel threatened by continuous Christianisation activities. After several Catholic missionaries were detained, the French Navy intervened in 1843 to free them, as the kingdom was perceived as xenophobic. In a series of conquests from 1859 to 1885, France eroded Vietnam's sovereignty. At the siege of Tourane in 1858, France was aided by Spain (with Filipino, Latin American, and Spanish troops from the Philippines)[88] and perhaps some Tonkinese Catholics. After the 1862 Treaty, and especially after France completely conquered Lower Cochinchina in 1867, the Văn Thân movement of scholar-gentry class arose and committed violence against Catholics across central and northern Vietnam.\n\nBetween 1862 and 1867, the southern third of the country became the French colony of Cochinchina. By 1884, the entire country was under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated into the two protectorates of Annam and Tonkin. The three entities were formally integrated into the union of French Indochina in 1887. The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society. A Western-style system of modern education introduced new humanist values. Most French settlers in Indochina were concentrated in Cochinchina, particularly in Saigon, and in Hanoi, the colony's capital.\n\nDuring the colonial period, guerrillas of the royalist Cần Vương movement rebelled against French rule and massacred around a third of Vietnam's Christian population. After a decade of resistance, they were defeated in the 1890s by the Catholics in reprisal for their earlier massacres. Another large-scale rebellion, the Thái Nguyên uprising, was also suppressed heavily. The French developed a plantation economy to promote export of tobacco, indigo, tea and coffee. However, they largely ignored the increasing demands for civil rights and self-government. An increasing dissatisfaction, even led to half-hearted, badly co-ordinated, and still worsely executed plots to oust the French, like the infamous Hanoi Poison Plot of 1908.\n\nA nationalist political movement soon emerged, with leaders like Phan Bội Châu, Phan Châu Trinh, Phan Đình Phùng, Emperor Hàm Nghi, and Hồ Chí Minh fighting or calling for independence. This resulted in the 1930 Yên Bái mutiny by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQDĐ), which the French quashed. The mutiny split the independence movement, as many leading members converted to communism.\n\nThe French maintained full control of their colonies until World War II, when the war in the Pacific led to the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in 1940. Afterwards, the Japanese Empire was allowed to station its troops in Vietnam while the pro-Vichy French colonial administration continued. Japan exploited Vietnam's natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a full-scale takeover of the country in March 1945. This led to the Vietnamese Famine of 1945 which killed up to two million people.\n\nIn 1941, the Việt Minh, a nationalist liberation movement based on a communist ideology, emerged under the Vietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh. The Việt Minh sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation. After the military defeat of Japan in World War II and the fall of its puppet government Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, Saigon's administrative services collapsed and chaos, riots, and murder were widespread. The Việt Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September.\n\nIn July 1945, the Allies had decided to divide Indochina at the 16th parallel to allow Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China to receive the Japanese surrender in the north while Britain's Lord Louis Mountbatten received their surrender in the south. The Allies agreed that Indochina still belonged to France.\n\nBut as the French were weakened by the German occupation, British-Indian forces and the remaining Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Group were used to maintain order and help France reestablish control through the 1945–1946 War in Vietnam. Hồ initially chose to take a moderate stance to avoid military conflict with France, asking the French to withdraw their colonial administrators and for French professors and engineers to help build a modern independent Vietnam. But the Provisional Government of the French Republic did not act on these requests, including the idea of independence, and dispatched the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to restore colonial rule. This resulted in the Việt Minh launching a guerrilla campaign against the French in late 1946. The resulting First Indochina War lasted until July 1954. The defeat of French colonialists and Vietnamese loyalists in the 1954 battle of Điện Biên Phủ allowed Hồ to negotiate a ceasefire from a favourable position at the subsequent Geneva Conference.\n\nThe colonial administration was thereby ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 21 July 1954 into three countries—Vietnam, and the kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos. Vietnam was further divided into North and South administrative regions at the Demilitarised Zone, roughly along the 17th parallel north (pending elections scheduled for July 1956[k]). A 300-day period of free movement was permitted, during which almost a million northerners, mainly Catholics, moved south, fearing persecution by the communists. This migration was in large part aided by the United States military through Operation Passage to Freedom. The partition of Vietnam by the Geneva Accords was not intended to be permanent, and stipulated that Vietnam would be reunited after the elections. But in 1955, the southern State of Vietnam's prime minister, Ngô Đình Diệm, toppled Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother Ngô Đình Nhu, and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam. This effectively replaced the internationally recognised State of Vietnam by the Republic of Vietnam in the south—supported by the United States, France, Laos, Republic of China and Thailand—and Hồ's Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, supported by the Soviet Union, Sweden,[126] Khmer Rouge, and the People's Republic of China.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted agrarian reforms including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which resulted in significant political repression. This included 13,500 to as many as 100,000 executions. In the South, Diệm countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in \"political reeducation centres\". This programme incarcerated many non-communists, but was successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time. The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 people were killed in the process by November 1957. The pro-Hanoi Việt Cộng began a guerrilla campaign in South Vietnam in the late 1950s to overthrow Diệm's government. From 1960, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.\n\nIn 1963, Buddhist discontent with Diệm's Catholic regime erupted into mass demonstrations, leading to a violent government crackdown. This led to the collapse of Diệm's relationship with the United States, and ultimately to a 1963 coup in which he and Nhu were assassinated. The Diệm era was followed by more than a dozen successive military governments, before the pairing of Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu took control in mid-1965. Thiệu gradually outmaneuvered Kỳ and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971. During this political instability, the communists began to gain ground. To support South Vietnam's struggle against the communist insurgency, the United States used the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident as a pretext for increasing its contribution of military advisers. US forces became involved in ground combat operations by 1965, and at their peak several years later, numbered more than 500,000. The US also engaged in sustained aerial bombing. Meanwhile, China and the Soviet Union provided North Vietnam with significant material aid and 15,000 combat advisers. Communist forces supplying the Việt Cộng carried supplies along the Hồ Chí Minh trail, which passed through Laos.\n\nThe communists attacked South Vietnamese targets during the 1968 Tết Offensive. The campaign failed militarily, but shocked the American establishment and turned US public opinion against the war. During the offensive, communist troops massacred over 3,000 civilians at Huế. Facing an increasing casualty count, rising domestic opposition to the war, and growing international condemnation, the US began withdrawing from ground combat roles in the early 1970s. This also entailed an unsuccessful effort to strengthen and stabilise South Vietnam. Following the Paris Peace Accords of 27 January 1973, all American combat troops were withdrawn by 29 March 1973. In December 1974, North Vietnam captured the province of Phước Long and started a full-scale offensive, culminating in the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. South Vietnam was ruled by a provisional government for almost eight years while under North Vietnamese military occupation.\n\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The war had devastated Vietnam and killed 966,000 to 3.8 million people. A 1974 US Senate subcommittee estimated nearly 1.4 million Vietnamese civilians were killed or wounded between 1965 and 1974—including 415,000 killed.[159] In its aftermath, under Lê Duẩn's administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the US or the defunct South Vietnamese government, confounding Western fears, but up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labour. The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivisation of farms and factories. Many fled the country following the conclusion of the war. In 1978, in response to the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia ordering massacres of Vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of An Giang and Kiên Giang, the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia and removed them from power after occupying Phnom Penh. The intervention was a success, resulting in the establishment of a new, pro-Vietnam socialist government, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which ruled until 1989. However, this worsened relations with China, which had supported the Khmer Rouge. China later launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979, causing Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid, while mistrust of the Chinese government escalated.\n\nAt the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the \"old guard\" government with new leadership. The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguyễn Văn Linh, who became the party's new general secretary. He and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms known as Đổi Mới (\"Renovation\") that carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a \"socialist-oriented market economy\". Although the authority of the state remained unchallenged under Đổi Mới, the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation, and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries. Subsequently, Vietnam's economy achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports, and foreign investment, although these reforms also resulted in a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.\n\nIn 2021, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Nguyen Phu Trong, was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he was Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades.[176] He died 19 July 2024, and was followed by To Lam as General Secretary of the Communist Party.\n\nVietnam is located on the eastern Indochinese Peninsula between the latitudes 8° and 24°N, and the longitudes 102° and 110°E. It covers a total area of 331,210 km2 (127,881 sq mi)[8] or 331,699 km2 (128,070 sq mi).[9] The combined length of the country's land boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi), and its coastline is 3,444 km (2,140 mi) long. At its narrowest point in the central Quảng Bình province, the country is as little as 50 kilometres (31 mi) across, though it widens to around 600 kilometres (370 mi) in the north. Vietnam's land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20%. Mountains account for 40% of the country's land area, and tropical forests cover around 42%. The Red River Delta in the north, a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2 (5,792 sq mi), is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta in the south. Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits. The delta, covering about 40,000 km2 (15,444 sq mi), is a low-level plain no more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) above sea level at any point. It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 metres (196.9 to 262.5 ft) into the sea every year. The exclusive economic zone of Vietnam covers 417,663 km2 (161,261 sq mi) in the South China Sea.\n\nSouthern Vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands, the mountains of the Annamite Range, and extensive forests. Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land. The soil in much of the southern part of Vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation. Several minor earthquakes have been recorded. The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta. Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi Păng), which is located in Lào Cai province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high. From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Phú Quốc is the largest. The Hang Sơn Đoòng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba Bể Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.\n\nDue to differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, Vietnam's climate tends to vary considerably for each region. During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture. The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, especially in southern Vietnam compared to the north. Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging from between 21 and 35 °C (70 and 95 °F) over the year. In Hanoi and the surrounding areas of the Red River Delta, the temperatures are much lower between 15 and 33 °C (59 and 91 °F). Seasonal variations in the mountains, plateaus, and the northernmost areas are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from 3 °C (37 °F) in December and January to 37 °C (99 °F) in July and August. During winter, snow occasionally falls over the highest peaks of the far northern mountains near the Chinese border.[200] Vietnam receives high rates of precipitation in the form of rainfall with an average amount from 1,500 to 2,000 mm (60 to 80 in) during the monsoon seasons; this often causes flooding, especially in the cities with poor drainage systems. The country is also affected by tropical depressions, tropical storms and typhoons. Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with 55% of its population living in low-elevation coastal areas.[203]\n\nAs the country is located within the Indomalayan realm, Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity. This was noted in the country's National Environmental Condition Report in 2005. It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world's species. 15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic. Vietnam's fauna includes 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, and 120 amphibians. There are 840 birds and 310 mammals are found in Vietnam, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic. Vietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites—the Hạ Long Bay and Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park—together with nine biosphere reserves, including Cần Giờ Mangrove Forest, Cát Tiên, Cát Bà, Kiên Giang, the Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, Western Nghệ An, Cà Mau, and Cu Lao Cham Marine Park.\n\nVietnam is also home to 1,438 species of freshwater microalgae, constituting 9.6% of all microalgae species, as well as 794 aquatic invertebrates and 2,458 species of sea fish. In recent years, 13 genera, 222 species, and 30 taxa of flora have been newly described in Vietnam. Six new mammal species, including the saola, giant muntjac and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey have also been discovered, along with one new bird species, the endangered Edwards's pheasant. In the late 1980s, a small population of Javan rhinoceros was found in Cát Tiên National Park. However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010. In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species. The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.\n\nIn Vietnam, wildlife poaching has become a major concern. In 2000, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Education for Nature – Vietnam was founded to instill in the population the importance of wildlife conservation in the country. In the years that followed, another NGO called GreenViet was formed by Vietnamese youngsters for the enforcement of wildlife protection. Through collaboration between the NGOs and local authorities, many local poaching syndicates were crippled by their leaders' arrests. A study released in 2018 revealed Vietnam is a destination for the illegal export of rhinoceros horns from South Africa due to the demand for them as a medicine and a status symbol.\n\nThe main environmental concern that persists in Vietnam today is the legacy of the use of the chemical herbicide Agent Orange, which continues to cause birth defects and many health problems in the Vietnamese population. In the southern and central areas affected most by the chemical's use during the Vietnam War, nearly 4.8 million Vietnamese people have been exposed to it and suffered from its effects. In 2012, approximately 50 years after the war, the US began a US$43 million joint clean-up project in the former chemical storage areas in Vietnam to take place in stages. Following the completion of the first phase in Đà Nẵng in late 2017, the US announced its commitment to clean other sites, especially in the heavily impacted site of Biên Hòa.\n\nThe Vietnamese government spends over VNĐ10 trillion each year ($431.1 million) for monthly allowances and the physical rehabilitation of victims of the chemicals. In 2018, the Japanese engineering group Shimizu Corporation, working with Vietnamese military, built a plant for the treatment of soil polluted by Agent Orange. Plant construction costs were funded by the company itself. One of the long-term plans to restore southern Vietnam's damaged ecosystems is through the use of reforestation efforts. The Vietnamese government began doing this at the end of the war. It started by replanting mangrove forests in the Mekong Delta regions and in Cần Giờ outside Hồ Chí Minh City, where mangroves are important to ease (though not eliminate) flood conditions during monsoon seasons. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.35/10, ranking it 104th globally out of 172 countries.[224]\n\nApart from herbicide problems, arsenic in the ground water in the Mekong and Red River Deltas has also become a major concern. And most notoriously, unexploded ordnances (UXO) pose dangers to humans and wildlife—another bitter legacy from the long wars. As part of the continuous campaign to demine/remove UXOs, several international bomb removal agencies from the United Kingdom, Denmark, South Korea and the US have been providing assistance. The Vietnam government spends over VNĐ1 trillion ($44 million) annually on demining operations and additional hundreds of billions of đồng for treatment, assistance, rehabilitation, vocational training and resettlement of the victims of UXOs.\n\nVietnam is a unitary Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic, one of the two communist states (the other being Laos) in Southeast Asia. Although Vietnam remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist, with The Economist characterising its leadership as \"ardently capitalist communists\". Under the constitution, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) asserts their role in all branches of the country's politics and society. The president is the elected head of state and the commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the chairman of the Council of Supreme Defence and Security, and holds the second highest office in Vietnam as well as performing executive functions and state appointments and setting policy.\n\nThe general secretary of the CPV performs numerous key administrative functions, controlling the party's national organisation. The prime minister is the head of government, presiding over a council of ministers composed of five deputy prime ministers and the heads of 26 ministries and commissions. Only political organisations affiliated with or endorsed by the CPV are permitted to contest elections in Vietnam. These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and worker and trade unionist parties.\n\nThe National Assembly of Vietnam is the unicameral state legislature composed of 500 members. Headed by a chairman, it is superior to both the executive and judicial branches, with all government ministers being appointed from members of the National Assembly. The Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, headed by a chief justice, is the country's highest court of appeal, though it is also answerable to the National Assembly. Beneath the Supreme People's Court stand the provincial municipal courts and many local courts. Military courts possess special jurisdiction in matters of state security. Vietnam maintains the death penalty for numerous offences.\n\nIn 2023, a three-person collective leadership was responsible for governing Vietnam. President Võ Văn Thưởng,[239] Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính (since 2021)[240] and the most powerful leader Nguyễn Phú Trọng (since 2011) as the Communist Party of Vietnam's General Secretary.[241] On 22 May 2024, Tô Lâm, who previously served as the Minister of Public Security, was voted as the president of Vietnam by the National Assembly after Võ Văn Thưởng resigned on the same year due to corruption charges against him.[242] On 3 August 2024, Tô Lâm, who is also serving as the president, was elected by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam as the general secretary following the death of Nguyễn Phú Trọng on 19 July 2024.[243][244] On 21 October 2024, the National Assembly appointed army general Lương Cường as president, succeeding Tô Lâm.[245]\n\nVietnam is divided into 57 provinces (Vietnamese: Tỉnh, chữ Hán: 省). There are also six municipalities (thành phố trực thuộc trung ương), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.\n\nProvinces are subdivided into provincial municipalities (thành phố trực thuộc tỉnh, 'city under province'), townships (thị xã) and counties (huyện), which are in turn subdivided into towns (thị trấn) or communes (xã).\n\nCentrally controlled municipalities are subdivided into districts (quận) and counties, which are further subdivided into wards (phường).\n\nThroughout its history, Vietnam's main foreign relationship has been with various Chinese dynasties. Following the partition of Vietnam in 1954, North Vietnam maintained relations with the Eastern Bloc, South Vietnam maintained relations with the Western Bloc. Despite these differences, Vietnam's sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries before its independence. These include the 11th-century patriotic poem \"Nam quốc sơn hà\" and the 1428 proclamation of independence \"Bình Ngô đại cáo\". Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace, significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries over the South China Sea. Vietnam holds membership in 63 international organisations, including the United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie), and World Trade Organization (WTO). It also maintains relations with over 650 non-governmental organisations. As of 2010 Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries.\n\nVietnam's current foreign policy is to consistently implement a policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, co-operation, and development, as well openness, diversification, multilateralisation with international relations. The country declares itself a friend and partner of all countries in the international community, regardless of their political affiliation, by actively taking part in international and regional cooperative development projects. Since the 1990s, Vietnam has taken several key steps to restore diplomatic ties with capitalist Western countries. It already had relations with communist Western countries in the decades prior. Relations with the United States began improving in August 1995 with both states upgrading their liaison offices to embassy status. As diplomatic ties between the two governments grew, the United States opened a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City while Vietnam opened its consulate in San Francisco. Full diplomatic relations were also restored with New Zealand, which opened its embassy in Hanoi in 1995; Vietnam established an embassy in Wellington in 2003. President of the United States, Bill Clinton, made a historic visit to Vietnam in November 2000. He was the first U.S. leader ever to officially visit Hanoi and the first to visit Vietnam since U.S. troops withdrew from the country in 1975.[257] Pakistan also reopened its embassy in Hanoi in October 2000, with Vietnam reopening its embassy in Islamabad in December 2005 and trade office in Karachi in November 2005. In May 2016, US President Barack Obama further normalised relations with Vietnam after he announced the lifting of an arms embargo on sales of lethal arms to Vietnam. Despite their historical past, today Vietnam is considered to be a potential ally of the United States, especially in the geopolitical context of the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and in containment of Chinese expansionism.\n\nThe Vietnam People's Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the Vietnam People's Public Security and the Vietnam Self-Defence Militia. The VPA is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People's Ground Forces, the Vietnam People's Navy, the Vietnam People's Air Force, the Vietnam Border Guard and the Vietnam Coast Guard. The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000. In 2015, Vietnam's military expenditure totalled approximately US$4.4 billion, equivalent to around 8% of its total government spending. Joint military exercises and war games have been held with Brunei, India, Japan, Laos, Russia, Singapore and the US. In 2017, Vietnam signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nThe government of Vietnam, reduced from a totalitarian system to an authoritarian one, carries many legacies of its past; the freedom of assembly, association, expression, press and religion as well as civil society activism being tightly restricted.[274][275] Under the current constitution, the CPV is the only party allowed to rule, the operation of all other political parties being outlawed. Other human rights issues concern freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press. In 2009, Vietnamese lawyer Lê Công Định was arrested and charged with the capital crime of subversion; several of his associates were also arrested. Amnesty International described him and his arrested associates as prisoners of conscience. Vietnam has also suffered from human trafficking and related issues.[278][279][280]\n\nThroughout the history of Vietnam, its economy has been based largely on agriculture—primarily wet rice cultivation. Bauxite, an important material in the production of aluminium, is mined in central Vietnam. Since reunification, the country's economy is shaped primarily by the CPV through Five Year Plans decided upon at the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses. The collectivisation of farms, factories, and capital goods was carried out as part of the establishment of central planning, with millions of people working for state enterprises. Under strict state control, Vietnam's economy continued to be plagued by inefficiency, corruption in state-owned enterprises, poor quality and underproduction. With the decline in economic aid from its main trading partner, the Soviet Union, following the erosion of the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the negative impacts of the post-war trade embargo imposed by the United States, Vietnam began to liberalise its trade by devaluing its exchange rate to increase exports and embarked on a policy of economic development.\n\nIn 1986, the Sixth National Congress of the CPV introduced socialist-oriented market economic reforms as part of the Đổi Mới reform programme. Private ownership began to be encouraged in industry, commerce and agriculture and state enterprises were restructured to operate under market constraints. This led to the five-year economic plans being replaced by the socialist-oriented market mechanism. As a result of these reforms, Vietnam achieved approximately 8% annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1990 and 1997. The United States ended its economic embargo against Vietnam in early 1994. Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis caused an economic slowdown to 4–5% growth per year, its economy began to recover in 1999, and grew at around 7% per year from 2000 to 2005, one of the fastest in the world.[296] On 11 January 2007, Vietnam became the 150th member of the WTO (World Trade Organization).[298] According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), growth remained strong despite the late-2000s global recession, holding at 6.8% in 2010. Vietnam's year-on-year inflation rate reached 11.8% in December 2010 and the currency, the Vietnamese đồng, was devalued three times.\n\nDeep poverty, defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1 per day, has declined significantly in Vietnam and the relative poverty rate is now less than that of China, India and the Philippines. This decline can be attributed to equitable economic policies aimed at improving living standards and preventing the rise of inequality. These policies have included egalitarian land distribution during the initial stages of the Đổi Mới programme, investment in poorer remote areas, and subsidising of education and healthcare. Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has applied sequenced trade liberalisation, a two-track approach opening some sectors of the economy to international markets. Manufacturing, information technology and high-tech industries now form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy. Although Vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil industry, it is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia with a total 2011 output of 318,000 barrels per day (50,600 m3/d). In 2010, Vietnam was ranked as the eighth-largest crude petroleum producer in the Asia and Pacific region. The US bought the biggest share of Vietnam's exports, while goods from China were the most popular Vietnamese import.\n\nBased on findings by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2022, the unemployment rate in Vietnam was 2.3%, the nominal GDP US$406.452 billion, and a nominal GDP per capita $4,086.[12] Besides the primary sector economy, tourism has contributed significantly to Vietnam's economic growth with 7.94 million foreign visitors recorded in 2015.\n\nAs a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products. It is now the world's largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share; the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world's market; and the second-largest rice exporter in the world after Thailand since the 1990s. Subsequently, Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee. The country has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops together with other states in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Other primary exports include tea, rubber and fishery products. Agriculture's share of Vietnam's GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006 as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.\n\nThe overall fisheries production of Vietnam from capture fisheries and aquaculture was 5.6 million MT in 2011 and 6.7 million MT in 2016. The output of Vietnam's fisheries sector has seen strong growth, which could be attributed to the continued expansion of the aquaculture sub-sector.[317]\n\nIn 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology amounted to roughly 0.45% of its GDP. Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics. Hoàng Tụy pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimisation in the 20th century, while Ngô Bảo Châu won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms. Since the establishment of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) by the government in 1975, the country is working to develop its first national space flight programme especially after the completion of the infrastructure at the Vietnam Space Centre (VSC) in 2018. Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model. One of Vietnam's main messaging apps, Zalo, was developed by Vương Quang Khải, a Vietnamese hacker who later worked with the country's largest information technology service company, the FPT Group.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Vietnam devoted 0.19% of its GDP to science research and development in 2011. Vietnam was ranked 44th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2012, where it was ranked 76th.[328][329] Between 2005 and 2014, the number of Vietnamese scientific publications recorded in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science increased at a rate well above the average for Southeast Asia, albeit from a modest starting point. Publications focus mainly on life sciences (22%), physics (13%) and engineering (13%), which is consistent with recent advances in the production of diagnostic equipment and shipbuilding.\n\nTourism is an important element of economic activity in the nation, contributing 7.5% of the total GDP. Vietnam hosted roughly 13 million tourists in 2017, an increase of 29.1% over the previous year, making it one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world. The vast majority of the tourists in the country, some 9.7 million, came from Asia; namely China (4 million), South Korea (2.6 million), and Japan (798,119). Vietnam also attracts large numbers of visitors from Europe, with almost 1.9 million visitors in 2017; most European visitors came from Russia (574,164), followed by the United Kingdom (283,537), France (255,396), and Germany (199,872). Other significant international arrivals by nationality include the United States (614,117) and Australia (370,438).\n\nThe most visited destinations in Vietnam are the largest city, Ho Chi Minh City, with over 5.8 million international arrivals, followed by Hanoi with 4.6 million and Hạ Long, including Hạ Long Bay with 4.4 million arrivals. All three are ranked in the top 100 most visited cities in the world. Vietnam is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2018, Travel + Leisure ranked Hội An as one of the world's top 15 best destinations to visit.\n\nMuch of Vietnam's modern transportation network can trace its roots to the French colonial era when it was used to facilitate the transportation of raw materials to its main ports. It was extensively expanded and modernised following the partition of Vietnam. Vietnam's road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns and commune roads managed at the commune level. In 2010, Vietnam's road system had a total length of about 188,744 kilometres (117,280 mi) of which 93,535 kilometres (58,120 mi) are asphalt roads comprising national, provincial and district roads. The length of the national road system is about 15,370 kilometres (9,550 mi) with 15,085 kilometres (9,373 mi) of its length paved. The provincial road system has around 27,976 kilometres (17,383 mi) of paved roads while 50,474 kilometres (31,363 mi) district roads are paved.\n\nBicycles, motorcycles and motor scooters remain the most popular forms of road transport in the country, a legacy of the French, though the number of privately owned cars has been increasing in recent years. Public buses operated by private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population. Traffic collisions remain the major safety issue of Vietnamese transportation with an average of 30 people losing their lives daily. Traffic congestion is a growing problem in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City especially with the growth of individual car ownership. Vietnam's primary cross-country rail service is the Reunification Express from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, a distance of nearly 1,726 kilometres (1,072 mi). From Hanoi, railway lines branch out to the northeast, north, and west; the eastbound line runs from Hanoi to Hạ Long Bay, the northbound line from Hanoi to Thái Nguyên, and the northeast line from Hanoi to Lào Cai. In 2009, Vietnam and Japan signed a deal to build a high-speed railway—shinkansen (bullet train)—using Japanese technology. Vietnamese engineers were sent to Japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains. The planned railway will be a 1,545 kilometres (960 mi)-long express route serving a total of 23 stations, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with 70% of its route running on bridges and through tunnels. The trains will travel at a maximum speed of 350 kilometres (220 mi) per hour. Plans for the high-speed rail line, however, have been postponed after the Vietnamese government decided to prioritise the development of both the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City metros and expand road networks instead.\n\nVietnam operates 20 major civil airports, including three international gateways: Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in Đà Nẵng and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City. Tan Son Nhat is the country's largest airport handling the majority of international passenger traffic. According to a government-approved plan, Vietnam will have another seven international airports by 2025, including Vinh International Airport, Phu Bai International Airport, Cam Ranh International Airport, Phu Quoc International Airport, Cat Bi International Airport, Can Tho International Airport, and Long Thanh International Airport. The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100 million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2025. Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned national airline, maintains a fleet of 86 passenger aircraft and aims to operate 170 by 2020. Several private airlines also operate in Vietnam, including Air Mekong, Bamboo Airways, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, VASCO and VietJet Air. As a coastal country, Vietnam has many major sea ports, including Cam Ranh, Đà Nẵng, Hải Phòng, Ho Chi Minh City, Hạ Long, Qui Nhơn, Vũng Tàu, Cửa Lò and Nha Trang. Further inland, the country's extensive network of rivers plays a key role in rural transportation with over 47,130 kilometres (29,290 mi) of navigable waterways carrying ferries, barges and water taxis.\n\nVietnam's energy sector is dominated largely by the state-controlled Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN). As of 2017, EVN made up about 61.4% of the country's power generation system with a total power capacity of 25,884 MW. Other energy sources are PetroVietnam (4,435 MW), Vinacomin (1,785 MW) and 10,031 MW from build–operate–transfer (BOT) investors.\n\nMost of Vietnam's power is generated by either hydropower or fossil fuel power such as coal, oil and gas, while diesel, small hydropower and renewable energy supplies the remainder. The Vietnamese government had planned to develop a nuclear reactor as the path to establish another source for electricity from nuclear power. The plan was abandoned in late 2016 when a majority of the National Assembly voted to oppose the project due to widespread public concern over radioactive contamination.\n\nThe household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country's domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nhơn Trạch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Phú Quý Wind Power Plant (6 MW), Hủa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and Vũng Áng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).\n\nAccording to statistics from BP, Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4 billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nTelecommunications services in Vietnam are wholly provided by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications General Corporation (now the VNPT Group) which is a state-owned company. The VNPT retained its monopoly until 1986. The telecom sector was reformed in 1995 when the Vietnamese government began to implement a competitive policy with the creation of two domestic telecommunication companies, the Military Electronic and Telecommunication Company (Viettel, which is wholly owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defence) and the Saigon Post and Telecommunication Company (SPT or SaigonPostel), with 18% of it owned by VNPT. VNPT's monopoly was finally ended by the government in 2003 with the issuance of a decree. By 2012, the top three telecom operators in Vietnam were Viettel, Vinaphone and MobiFone. The remaining companies included: EVNTelecom, Vietnammobile and S-Fone. With the shift towards a more market-orientated economy, Vietnam's telecommunications market is continuously being reformed to attract foreign investment, which includes the supply of services and the establishment of nationwide telecom infrastructure.\n\nVietnam has 2,360 rivers with an average annual discharge of 310 billion m3. The rainy season accounts for 70% of the year's discharge. Most of the country's urban water supply systems have been developed without proper management within the last 10 years. Based on a 2008 survey by the Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), existing water production capacity exceeded demand, but service coverage is still sparse. Most of the clean water supply infrastructure is not widely developed. It is only available to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply. There is also concern over the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems. Most industrial factories release their untreated wastewater directly into the water sources. Where the government does not take measures to address the issue, most domestic wastewater is discharged, untreated, back into the environment and pollutes the surface water.\n\nIn recent years, there have been some efforts and collaboration between local and foreign universities to develop access to safe water in the country by introducing water filtration systems. There is a growing concern among local populations over the serious public health issues associated with water contamination caused by pollution as well as the high levels of arsenic in groundwater sources. The government of Netherlands has been providing aid focusing its investments mainly on water-related sectors including water treatment projects. Regarding sanitation, 78% of Vietnam's population has access to \"improved\" sanitation—94% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population. However, there are still about 21 million people in the country lacking access to \"improved\" sanitation according to a survey conducted in 2015. In 2018, the construction ministry said the country's water supply, and drainage industry had been applying hi-tech methods and information technology (IT) to sanitation issues but faced problems like limited funding, climate change, and pollution. The health ministry has also announced that water inspection units will be established nationwide beginning in June 2019. Inspections are to be conducted without notice, since there have been many cases involving health issues caused by poor or polluted water supplies as well unhygienic conditions reported every year.\n\nAs of 2021 , the population of Vietnam stands at approximately 97.5 million people. The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7 million. According to the 2019 census, the country's population was 96,208,984. Based on the 2019 census, 65.6% of the Vietnamese population live in rural areas while only 34.4% live in urban areas. The average growth rate of the urban population has recently increased which is attributed mainly to migration and rapid urbanisation. The dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constitute 82,085,826 people or 85.32% of the population. Most of their population is concentrated in the country's alluvial deltas and coastal plains. As a majority ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country. Despite this, Vietnam is also home to various ethnic groups, of which 54 are officially recognised, including the Hmong, Dao, Tày, Thái and Nùng. Many ethnic minorities such as the Muong, who are closely related to the Kinh, dwell in the highlands which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.\n\nSince the partition of Vietnam, the population of the Central Highlands was almost exclusively Degar (including more than 40 tribal groups); however, the South Vietnamese government at the time enacted a programme of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas. The Hoa (ethnic Chinese) and Khmer Krom people are mainly lowlanders. Throughout Vietnam's history, many Chinese people, largely from South China, migrated to the country as administrators, merchants and even refugees. Since the reunification in 1976, an increase of communist policies nationwide resulted in the nationalisation and confiscation of property especially from the Hoa in the south and the wealthy in cities. This led many of them to leave Vietnam.\n\nThe number of people who live in urbanised areas in 2019 is 33,122,548 people (with the urbanisation rate at 34.4%). Since 1986, Vietnam's urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the Vietnamese government implemented the Đổi Mới economic programme, changing the system into a socialist one and liberalising property rights. As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively. The Vietnamese government, through its construction ministry, forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020 although it was confirmed to only be 34.4% according to the 2019 census. Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth. Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate. Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country's Southeast region. Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities.\n\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%. In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009. In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.\n\nMany Vietnamese use mopeds for transportation, since they are relatively cheap and easy to operate. Their large numbers have been known to cause traffic congestion and air pollution in Vietnam. In the capital city alone, the number of mopeds increased from 0.5 million in 2001 to 4.7 million in 2013. With rapid development, factories have sprung up which indirectly pollute the air and water, for example in the 2016 Vietnam marine life disaster. The government is intervening and attempting solutions to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation. It has introduced more regulations for waste handling. The amount of solid waste generated in urban areas of Vietnam has increased by more than 200% from 2003 to 2008. Industrial solid waste accounted for 181% of that increase. One of the government's efforts includes attempting to promote campaigns that encourage locals to sort household waste, since waste sorting is still not practised by most of Vietnamese society.\n\nThe national language of the country is Vietnamese, a tonal Austroasiatic language (Mon–Khmer), which is spoken by the majority of the population. Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including: Tày, Mường, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, Nùng, and Hmong. The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages, some belonging to the Austroasiatic and others to the Malayo-Polynesian language families. In recent years, a number of sign languages have developed in the major cities.\n\nThe French language, a legacy of colonial rule, is spoken by many educated Vietnamese as a second language, especially among those educated in the former South Vietnam, where it was a principal language in administration, education and commerce.[391] Vietnam remains a full member of the International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie) and education has revived some interest in the language. Russian, and to a lesser extent German, Czech and Polish are known among some northern Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. With improved relations with Western countries and recent reforms in Vietnamese administration, English has been increasingly used as a second language and the study of English is now obligatory in most schools either alongside or in place of French. The popularity of Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese have also grown as the country's ties with other East Asian nations have strengthened. Third-graders can choose one of seven languages (English, Russian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German) as their first foreign language.[399][400][401] In Vietnam's high school graduation examinations, students can take their foreign language exam in one of the above-mentioned languages.[402]\n\nUnder Article 70 of the 1992 Constitution of Vietnam, all citizens enjoy freedom of belief and religion. All religions are equal before the law and each place of worship is protected under Vietnamese state law. Religious beliefs cannot be misused to undermine state law and policies. According to a 2007 survey 81% of Vietnamese people did not believe in a god. Based on government findings in 2009, the number of religious people increased by 932,000. The official statistics, presented by the Vietnamese government to the United Nations special rapporteur in 2014, indicate the overall number of followers of recognised religions is about 24 million of a total population of almost 90 million. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam in 2019, Buddhists account for 4.79% of the total population, Catholics 6.1%, Protestants 1.0%, Hoahao Buddhists 1.02%, and Caodaism followers 0.58%. Other religions includes Islam, Bahaʼís and Hinduism, representing less than 0.2% of the population.\n\nThe majority of Vietnamese do not follow any organised religion, though many of them observe some form of Vietnamese folk religion. Confucianism as a system of social and ethical philosophy still has certain influences in modern Vietnam. Mahāyāna is the dominant branch of Buddhism, while Theravada is practised mostly by the Khmer minority. About 8 to 9% of the population is Christian—made up of Roman Catholics and Protestants. Catholicism was introduced to Vietnam in the 16th century and was firmly established by Jesuits missionaries (mainly Portuguese and Italian) in the 17th centuries from nearby Portuguese Macau. French missionaries (from the Paris Foreign Missions Society) together with Spanish missionaries (from the Dominican Order of the neighbouring Spanish East Indies) actively sought converts in the 18th, 19th, and first half of the 20th century. A significant number of Vietnamese people, especially in the South, are also adherents of two indigenous religions of syncretic Caodaism and quasi-Buddhist Hoahaoism. Protestantism was only recently spread by American and Canadian missionaries in the 20th century; the largest Protestant denomination is the Evangelical Church of Vietnam. Around 770,000 of the country's Protestants are members of ethnic minorities, particularly the highland Montagnards and Hmong people. Although it is one of the country's minority religions, Protestantism is the fastest-growing religion in Vietnam, expanding at a rate of 600% in recent decades. Several other minority faiths exist in Vietnam, these include: Bani, Sunni and non-denominational sections of Islam which is practised primarily among the ethnic Cham minority. There are also a few Kinh adherents of Islam, other minority adherents of Baha'i, as well as Hindus among the Cham's.\n\nVietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges, and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions. General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities. A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90% in 2008. Most universities are located in major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with the country's education system continuously undergoing a series of reforms by the government. Basic education in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fees for their children without some form of public or private assistance. Regardless, Vietnam's school enrolment is among the highest in the world. The number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005. In higher education, the government provides subsidised loans for students through the national bank, although there are deep concerns about access to the loans as well the burden on students to repay them. Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 2.2 million with 84,000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education. A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including Harvard University (United States) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Australia). The government's strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics. In 2018, a decree on university autonomy allowing them to operate independently without ministerial control is in its final stages of approval. The government will continue investing in education especially for the poor to have access to basic education.\n\nBy 2015, 97% of the population had access to improved water sources. In 2016, Vietnam's national life expectancy stood at 80.9 years for women and 71.5 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births. Since the partition, North Vietnam has established a public health system that has reached down to the hamlet level. After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established. In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 24.7 hospital beds per 10,000 people before declining to 23.7 in 2005 as stated in the annual report of Vietnamese Health Ministry. The controversial use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the US military during the war left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people that persist in the country today. For instance, it led to three million Vietnamese people suffering health problems, one million birth defects caused directly by exposure to the chemical and 24% of Vietnam's land being defoliated.\n\nSince the early 2000s, Vietnam has made significant progress in combating malaria. The malaria mortality rate fell to about five per cent of its 1990s equivalent by 2005 after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment. Tuberculosis (TB) cases, however, are on the rise. TB has become the second most infectious disease in the country after respiratory-related illness. With an intensified vaccination programme, better hygiene and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of TB cases and new TB infections. In 2004, government subsidies covering about 15% of health care expenses. That year, the United States announced Vietnam would be one of 15 states to receive funding as part of its global AIDS relief plan. By the following year, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases, of which 16,528 progressed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); 9,554 have died. The actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher. On average between 40 and 50 new infections are reported daily in the country. In 2007, 0.4% of the population was estimated to be infected with HIV and the figure has remained stable since 2005. More global aid is being delivered through The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to fight the spread of the disease in the country. In September 2018, the Hanoi People's Committee urged the citizens of the country to stop eating dog and cat meat as it can cause diseases like rabies and leptospirosis. More than 1,000 stores in the capital city of Hanoi were found to be selling both meats. The decision prompted positive comments among Vietnamese on social media, though some noted that the consumption of dog meat will remain an ingrained habit among many people.\n\nVietnamese culture is considered part of Sinosphere. Vietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient Đông Sơn culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base. Some elements of the nation's culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism, Mahāyāna Buddhism, and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy. Vietnamese society is structured around làng (ancestral villages); all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month. The influence of Chinese culture such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien, and Hainanese cultures is more evident in the north where Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture. Despite this, there are Chinatowns in the south, such as in Chợ Lớn, where many Chinese have intermarried with Kinh and are indistinguishable among them. In the central and southern parts of Vietnam, traces of Champa and Khmer culture are evidenced through the remains of ruins, artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient Sa Huỳnh culture. In recent centuries, Western cultures have become popular among recent generations of Vietnamese.\n\nThe traditional focuses of Vietnamese culture are based on humanity (nhân nghĩa) and harmony (hòa) in which family and community values are highly regarded. Vietnam reveres a number of key cultural symbols, such as the Vietnamese dragon which is derived from crocodile and snake imagery; Vietnam's national father, Lạc Long Quân is depicted as a holy dragon. The lạc is a holy bird representing Vietnam's national mother Âu Cơ. Other prominent images that are also revered are the turtle, buffalo and horse. Many Vietnamese also believe in the supernatural and spiritualism where illness can be brought on by a curse or sorcery or caused by non-observance of a religious ethic. Traditional medical practitioners, amulets and other forms of spiritual protection and religious practices may be employed to treat the ill person. In the modern era, the cultural life of Vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and cultural programmes. For many decades, foreign cultural influences, especially those of Western origin, were shunned. But since the recent reformation, Vietnam has seen a greater exposure to neighbouring Southeast Asian, East Asian as well to Western culture and media.\n\nThe main Vietnamese formal dress, the áo dài is worn for special occasions such as weddings and religious festivals. White áo dài is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across the country. Other examples of traditional Vietnamese clothing include: the áo tứ thân, a four-piece woman's dress; the áo ngũ, a form of the thân in five-piece form, mostly worn in the north of the country; the yếm, a woman's undergarment; the áo bà ba, rural working \"pyjamas\" for men and women; the áo gấm, a formal brocade tunic for government receptions; and the áo the, a variant of the áo gấm worn by grooms at weddings. Traditional headwear includes the standard conical nón lá, the \"lampshade-like\" nón quai thao, and the traditional turban, khăn vấn. In tourism, a number of popular cultural tourist destinations include the former Imperial City of Huế, the World Heritage Sites of Phong Nha – Kẻ Bàng National Park, Hội An and Mỹ Sơn, coastal regions such as Nha Trang, the caves of Hạ Long Bay and the Marble Mountains.\n\nVietnamese literature has centuries-deep history and the country has a rich tradition of folk literature based on the typical six–to-eight-verse poetic form (lục bát) called ca dao which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes. Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th century Ngô dynasty, with notable ancient authors including: Nguyễn Trãi, Hồ Xuân Hương, Nguyễn Du and Nguyễn Đình Chiểu. Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as hát nói in ca trù. Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the tao đàn. Vietnamese literature has been influenced by Western styles in recent times, with the first literary transformation movement of thơ mới emerging in 1932. Vietnamese folk literature is an intermingling of many forms. It is not only an oral tradition, but a mixing of three media: hidden (only retained in the memory of folk authors), fixed (written), and shown (performed). Folk literature usually exists in many versions, passed down orally, and has unknown authors. Myths consist of stories about supernatural beings, heroes, creator gods and reflect the viewpoint of ancient people about human life. They consist of creation stories, stories about their origins (Lạc Long Quân and Âu Cơ), culture heroes (Sơn Tinh and Thủy Tinh) which are referred to as a mountain and water spirit respectively and many other folklore tales.\n\nTraditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions. Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form and is traditionally more formal. The origins of Vietnamese classical opera (tuồng) can be traced to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe. Throughout its history, Vietnam has been the most heavily impacted by the Chinese musical tradition along with those of Japan, Korea and Mongolia. Nhã nhạc is the most popular form of imperial court music, Chèo is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, while Xẩm or hát xẩm (xẩm singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music. Quan họ (alternate singing) is popular in the former Hà Bắc province (which is now divided into Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces) and across Vietnam. Another form of music called Hát chầu văn or hát văn is used to invoke spirits during ceremonies. Nhạc dân tộc cải biên is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s, while ca trù (also known as hát ả đào) is a popular folk music. Hò can be thought of as the southern style of Quan họ. There is a range of traditional instruments, including the đàn bầu (a monochord zither), the đàn gáo (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the đàn nguyệt (a two-stringed fretted moon lute). In recent times, there have been some efforts at mixing Vietnamese traditional music—especially folk music—with modern music to revive and promote national music in the modern context and educate the younger generations about Vietnam's traditional musical instruments and singing styles. Bolero music has gained popularity in the country since the 1930s, albeit with a different style—a combination of traditional Vietnamese music with Western elements. In the 21st century, the modern Vietnamese pop music industry known as V-pop incorporates elements of many popular genres worldwide, such as electronic, dance and R&B.\n\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government under the 2004 Law on Publication. It is generally perceived that the country's media sector is controlled by the government and follows the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken. The Voice of Vietnam (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website, while Vietnam Television (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company. Since 1997, Vietnam has regulated public internet access extensively using both legal and technical means. The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the \"Bamboo Firewall\". The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam's level of online political censorship to be \"pervasive\", while Reporters Without Borders (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global \"internet enemies\". Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content, many political and religious websites that are deemed to be undermining state authority are also blocked.\n\nTraditionally, Vietnamese cuisine is based around five fundamental taste \"elements\" (Vietnamese: ngũ vị): spicy (metal), sour (wood), salty (water), bitter (fire) and sweet (earth). Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese recipes use: lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chilli, lime and basil leaves. Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables; it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide. The use of meats such as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past. Instead freshwater fish, crustaceans (particularly crabs), and molluscs became widely used. Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients. Vietnam has a strong street food culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country. Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as gỏi cuốn (salad roll), bánh cuốn (rice noodle roll), bún riêu (rice vermicelli soup) and phở noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants. Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices. Black pepper is frequently used in place of chillis to produce spicy flavours. Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with ice cubes, especially during the annual hot seasons; in contrast, in the north hot drinks are more preferable in a colder climate. Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include cà phê đá (Vietnamese iced coffee), cà phê trứng (egg coffee), chanh muối (salted pickled lime juice), cơm rượu (glutinous rice wine), nước mía (sugarcane juice) and trà sen (Vietnamese lotus tea).\n\nThe country has eleven national recognised holidays. These include: New Year's Day on 1 January; Vietnamese New Year (Tết Nguyên Đán) from the last day of the last lunar month to fifth day of the first lunar month; Hùng Kings' Festival on the 10th day of the third lunar month; Reunification Day on 30 April; International Workers' Day on 1 May; and National Day on 2 September. During Tết, many Vietnamese from the major cities will return to their villages for family reunions and to pray for dead ancestors. Older people will usually give the young a lì xì (red envelope) while special holiday food, such as bánh chưng (rice cake) in a square shape together with variety of dried fruits, are presented in the house for visitors. Many other festivals are celebrated throughout the seasons, including the Tết Nguyên Tiêu, Tết Trung Thu and various temple and nature festivals. In the highlands, Elephant Race Festivals are held annually during the spring; riders will ride their elephants for about 1.6 km (0.99 mi) and the winning elephant will be given sugarcane. Traditional Vietnamese weddings remain widely popular.\n\nThe Vovinam, Kim Kê and Võ Bình Định are widespread in Vietnam, while football is the country's most popular sport. Its national team won the ASEAN Football Championship twice in 2008 and 2018 and reached the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, quarter-finals of 2019 AFC Asian Cup, its junior team of under-23 became the runners-up of 2018 AFC U-23 Championship and reached fourth place in 2018 Asian Games, while the under-20 managed to qualify the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup for the first time in their football history. And the under-17 achieved the fourth place per 10 Teams of the 2000 AFC U-16 Championship. The women's national football team had first appearance at the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023, became the first 11-a-side national football team to participate in a World Cup tournament, and also traditionally dominates the Southeast Asian Games, along with its chief rival, Thailand. Other Western sports such as badminton, tennis, volleyball, ping-pong and chess are also widely popular. Vietnam has participated in the Summer Olympic Games since 1952. After the partition of the country in 1954, only South Vietnam competed in the games, sending athletes to the 1956 and 1972 Olympics. Since the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, it has competed as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, attending every Summer Olympics from 1988 onwards. The present Vietnam Olympic Committee was formed in 1976 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1979. Vietnam has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games. In 2016, Vietnam won their first gold medal at the Olympics. Basketball has become an increasingly popular sport in Vietnam, especially in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Sóc Trăng.[509]\n• Portal of the Government of Vietnam Archived 20 May 2020 at the Wayback Machine\n• Communist Party of Vietnam – official website (in Vietnamese)\n• Robert N.

It is the official language of Andorra, and an official language of three autonomous communities in eastern Spain: Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community, where it is called Valencian (valencià). It has semi-official status in the Italian comune of Alghero,[3] and it is spoken in the Pyrénées-Orientales department of France and in two further areas in eastern Spain: the eastern strip of Aragon and the Carche area in the Region of Murcia. The Catalan-speaking territories are often called the Països Catalans or \"Catalan Countries\".[4]\n\nThe language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees. Nineteenth-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, culminating in the early 1900s.\n\nThe word Catalan is derived from the territorial name of Catalonia, itself of disputed etymology. The main theory suggests that Catalunya (Latin: Gathia Launia) derives from the name Gothia or Gauthia ('Land of the Goths'), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania > Catalonia theoretically derived.\n\nIn English, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as Catelaner, followed in the 15th century as Catellain (from Middle French). It is attested a language name since at least 1652. The word Catalan can be pronounced in English as KAT-ə-lən, -⁠lan or KAT-ə-LAN.[9][10]\n\nThe endonym is pronounced [kətəˈla] in the Eastern Catalan dialects, and [kataˈla] in the Western dialects. In the Valencian Community and Carche, the term valencià [valensiˈa] is frequently used instead. Thus, the name \"Valencian\", although often employed for referring to the varieties specific to the Valencian Community and Carche, is also used by Valencians as a name for the language as a whole,[11] synonymous with \"Catalan\".[11] Both uses of the term have their respective entries in the dictionaries by the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL)[note 1] and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC).[note 2] (See also status of Valencian below).\n\nBy the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees, as well as the territories of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis to the south. From the 8th century onwards the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards at the expense of the Muslims, bringing their language with them. This process was given definitive impetus with the separation of the County of Barcelona from the Carolingian Empire in 988.\n\nIn the 11th century, documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show Catalan elements, with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080. Old Catalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance, diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries.\n\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries the Catalan rulers expanded southward to the Ebro river, and in the 13th century they conquered the lands that would become the Kingdoms of Valencia and the Majorca. The city of Alghero in Sardinia was repopulated with Catalan speakers in the 14th century. The language also reached Murcia, which became Spanish-speaking in the 15th century.\n\nIn the Low Middle Ages, Catalan went through a golden age, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness. Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232–1315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th–14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March (1397–1459). By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon, and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world. During this period, the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language. Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th. During this period, the language was what Costa Carreras terms \"one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe\".\n\nMartorell's novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490) shows a transition from Medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in Metge's work. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.[16]\n\nWith the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon in 1479, the Spanish kings ruled over different kingdoms, each with its own cultural, linguistic and political particularities, and they had to swear by the laws of each territory before the respective parliaments. But after the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain became an absolute monarchy under Philip V, which led to the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Crown of Castile through the Nueva Planta decrees, as a first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state; as in other contemporary European states, this meant the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant groups.[18][19] Since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards national minorities have been a constant.[20][21][22][23][24][neutrality is disputed]\n\nThe process of assimilation began with secret instructions to the corregidores of the Catalan territory: they \"will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed\".[25] From there, actions in the service of assimilation, discreet or aggressive, were continued, and reached to the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal Certificate forbidding anyone to \"represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish\".[25] The use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the decline of Catalan. Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the nobles, part of the urban and literary classes became bilingual.\n\nWith the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Spain ceded the northern part of Catalonia to France, and soon thereafter the local Catalan varieties came under the influence of French, which in 1700 became the sole official language of the region.[26]\n\nShortly after the French Revolution (1789), the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the regional languages of France, such as Catalan, Alsatian, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque.\n\nAfter the French colony of Algeria was established in 1830, many Catalan-speaking settlers moved there. People from the Spanish province of Alicante settled around Oran, while those from French Catalonia and Menorca migrated to Algiers.\n\nBy 1911, there were around 100,000 speakers of Patuet,[27] as their speech was called.[28] After the Algerian declaration of independence in 1962, almost all the Pied-Noir Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia[29] or Alicante.\n\nThe French government only recognizes French as an official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the then General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales officially recognized Catalan as one of the départment's languages[31] and seeks to further promote it in public life and education.\n\nIn 1807, the Statistics Office of the French Ministry of the Interior asked the prefects for an official survey on the limits of the French language. The survey found that in Roussillon, almost only Catalan was spoken, and since Napoleon wanted to incorporate Catalonia into France, as happened in 1812, the consul in Barcelona was also asked. He declared that Catalan \"is taught in schools, it is printed and spoken, not only among the lower class, but also among people of first quality, also in social gatherings, as in visits and congresses\", indicating that it was spoken everywhere \"with the exception of the royal courts\". He also indicated that Catalan was spoken \"in the Kingdom of Valencia, in the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Sardinia, Corsica and much of Sicily, in the Vall d \"Aran and Cerdaña\".[32]\n\nThe defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) initiated a series of laws which, among other centralizing measures, imposed the use of Spanish in legal documentation all over Spain. Because of this, use of the Catalan language declined into the 18th century.\n\nHowever, the 19th century saw a Catalan literary revival (Renaixença), which has continued up to the present day. This period starts with Aribau's Ode to the Homeland (1833); followed in the second half of the 19th century, and the early 20th by the work of Verdaguer (poetry), Oller (realist novel), and Guimerà (drama). In the 19th century, the region of Carche, in the province of Murcia was repopulated with Valencian speakers. Catalan spelling was standardized in 1913 and the language became official during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). The Second Spanish Republic saw a brief period of tolerance, with most restrictions against Catalan lifted. The Generalitat (the autonomous government of Catalonia, established during the Republic in 1931) made a normal use of Catalan in its administration and put efforts to promote it at the social level, including in schools and the University of Barcelona.\n\nThe Catalan language and culture were still vibrant during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), but were crushed at an unprecedented level throughout the subsequent decades due to Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), which abolished the official status of Catalan and imposed the use of Spanish in schools and in public administration in all of Spain, while banning the use of Catalan in them.[35] Between 1939 and 1943 newspapers and book printing in Catalan almost disappeared.[36] Francisco Franco's desire for a homogeneous Spanish population resonated with some Catalans in favor of his regime, primarily members of the upper class, who began to reject the use of Catalan. Despite all of these hardships, Catalan continued to be used privately within households, and it was able to survive Franco's dictatorship. At the end of World War II, however, some of the harsh measures began to be lifted and, while Spanish language remained the sole promoted one, limited number of Catalan literature began to be tolerated. Several prominent Catalan authors resisted the suppression through literature.[37] Private initiative contests were created to reward works in Catalan, among them Joan Martorell prize (1947), Víctor Català prize (1953) Carles Riba award (1950), or the Honor Award of Catalan Letters (1969).[38] The first Catalan-language TV show was broadcast in 1964.[39] At the same time, oppression of the Catalan language and identity was carried out in schools, through governmental bodies, and in religious centers.[40]\n\nIn addition to the loss of prestige for Catalan and its prohibition in schools, migration during the 1950s into Catalonia from other parts of Spain also contributed to the diminished use of the language. These migrants were often unaware of the existence of Catalan, and thus felt no need to learn or use it. Catalonia was the economic powerhouse of Spain, so these migrations continued to occur from all corners of the country. Employment opportunities were reduced for those who were not bilingual.[41] Daily newspapers remained exclusively in Spanish until after Franco's death, when the first one in Catalan since the end of the Civil War, Avui, began to be published in 1976.[42]\n\nSince the Spanish transition to democracy (1975–1982), Catalan has been institutionalized as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige. In Catalonia, there is an unparalleled large bilingual European non-state linguistic community. The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools, but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia in two situations—if the teacher assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish, or during the learning process of one or more recently arrived immigrant students.[44] There is also some intergenerational shift towards Catalan.\n\nMore recently, several Spanish political forces have tried to increase the use of Spanish in the Catalan educational system.[45] As a result, in May 2022 the Spanish Supreme Court urged the Catalan regional government to enforce a measure by which 25% of all lessons must be taught in Spanish.[46]\n\nAccording to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia, in 2013 the Catalan language is the second most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language: 7% of the population self-identifies with both Catalan and Spanish equally, 36.4% with Catalan and 47.5% only Spanish.[47] In 2003 the same studies concluded no language preference for self-identification within the population above 15 years old: 5% self-identified with both languages, 44.3% with Catalan and 47.5% with Spanish.[48] To promote use of Catalan, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia's official Autonomous government) spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories, with entities such as Consorci per a la Normalització Lingüística [ca; es] (Consortium for Linguistic Normalization).[49][50]\n\nIn Andorra, Catalan has always been the sole official language. Since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several policies favoring Catalan have been enforced, such as Catalan medium education.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In the Northern Catalonia area of France, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004). Catalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary. The cultural association La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in Catalan language immersion programs.\n\nIn Alicante province, Catalan is being replaced by Spanish and in Alghero by Italian. There is also well ingrained diglossia in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.\n\nDuring the 20th century many Catalans emigrated or went into exile to Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, and other South American countries. They formed a large number of Catalan colonies that today continue to maintain the Catalan language.[51] They also founded many Catalan casals (associations).[52]\n\nOne classification of Catalan is given by Pèire Bèc:\n\nHowever, the ascription of Catalan to the Occitano-Romance branch of Gallo-Romance languages is not shared by all linguists and philologists, particularly among Spanish ones, such as Ramón Menéndez Pidal.\n\nCatalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.\n\nSome include Catalan in Occitan, as the linguistic distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon dialect) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century[53] and still today remains its closest relative.[54]\n\nCatalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, French, Italian, Sardinian as well as Spanish and Portuguese among others). However, despite being spoken mostly on the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan has marked differences with the Iberian Romance group (Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and especially vocabulary; it shows instead its closest affinity with languages native to France and northern Italy, particularly Occitan and to a lesser extent Gallo-Romance (Franco-Provençal, French, Gallo-Italian).[58]\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between Catalan and other Romance languages is: 87% with Italian; 85% with Portuguese and Spanish; 76% with Ladin and Romansh; 75% with Sardinian; and 73% with Romanian.[1]\n\nDuring much of its history, and especially during the Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), the Catalan language was ridiculed as a mere dialect of Spanish. This view, based on political and ideological considerations, has no linguistic validity. Spanish and Catalan have important differences in their sound systems, lexicon, and grammatical features, placing the language in features closer to Occitan (and French).\n\nThere is evidence that, at least from the 2nd century AD, the vocabulary and phonology of Roman Tarraconensis was different from the rest of Roman Hispania. Differentiation arose generally because Spanish, Asturian, and Galician-Portuguese share certain peripheral archaisms (Spanish hervir, Asturian and Portuguese ferver vs. Catalan bullir, Occitan bolir \"to boil\") and innovatory regionalisms (Spanish novillo, Asturian nuviellu vs. Catalan torell, Occitan taurèl \"bullock\"), while Catalan has a shared history with the Western Romance innovative core, especially Occitan.\n\nLike all Romance languages, Catalan has a handful of native words which are unique to it, or rare elsewhere. These include:\n• verbs: 'to fasten; transfix' > 'to compose, write up', > 'to combine, conjugate', > 'to wake; awaken', 'to thicken; crowd together' > 'to save, keep', > 'to miss, yearn, pine for', 'to investigate, track' > Old Catalan enagar 'to incite, induce', > Old Catalan ujar 'to exhaust, fatigue', > 'to appease, mollify', > 'to reject, refuse';\n\nThe Gothic superstrate produced different outcomes in Spanish and Catalan. For example, Catalan fang \"mud\" and rostir \"to roast\", of Germanic origin, contrast with Spanish lodo and asar, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan filosa \"spinning wheel\" and templa \"temple\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish rueca and sien, of Germanic origin.\n\nThe same happens with Arabic loanwords. Thus, Catalan alfàbia \"large earthenware jar\" and rajola \"tile\", of Arabic origin, contrast with Spanish tinaja and teja, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan oli \"oil\" and oliva \"olive\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish aceite and aceituna. However, the Arabic element is generally much more prevalent in Spanish.\n\nSituated between two large linguistic blocks (Iberian Romance and Gallo-Romance), Catalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar \"to miss somebody\", apaivagar \"to calm somebody down\", and rebutjar \"reject\".\n\nTraditionally Catalan-speaking territories are sometimes called the Països Catalans (Catalan Countries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status. Various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions.\n\nThe number of people known to be fluent in Catalan varies depending on the sources used. A 2004 study did not count the total number of speakers, but estimated a total of 9–9.5 million by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where Catalan is spoken.[69] The web site of the Generalitat de Catalunya estimated that as of 2004 there were 9,118,882 speakers of Catalan.[70] These figures only reflect potential speakers; today it is the native language of only 35.6% of the Catalan population.[71] According to Ethnologue, Catalan had 4.1 million native speakers and 5.1 million second-language speakers in 2021.[1]\n\nAccording to a 2011 study the total number of Catalan speakers was over 9.8 million, with 5.9 million residing in Catalonia. More than half of them spoke Catalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in Catalonia).[72] Very few Catalan monoglots exist; virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with 99.7% of Catalan speakers in Catalonia able to speak Spanish and 99.9% able to understand it.[73]\n\nIn Roussillon, only a minority of French Catalans speak Catalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of language shift. According to a 2019 survey by the Catalan government, 31.5% of the inhabitants of Catalonia predominantly spoke Catalan at home whereas 52.7% spoke Spanish, 2.8% both Catalan and Spanish and 10.8% other languages.[74]\n\nSpanish was the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. According to 2013 census, Catalan was also very commonly spoken in the city of 1,501,262: it was understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% over the age of two could speak it (1,137,816), 79% could read it (1,246.555), and 53% could write it (835,080).[75] The share of Barcelona residents who could speak it (72.3%)[76] was lower than that of the overall Catalan population, of whom 81.2% over the age of 15 spoke the language. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. An important social characteristic of the Catalan language is that all the areas where it is spoken are bilingual in practice: together with French in Roussillon, with Italian in Alghero, with Spanish and French in Andorra, and with Spanish in the rest of the territories.\n\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n• Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, other than Spanish.\n• Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician and Portuguese, but unlike French, Spanish, or Italian.\n• Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.\n\nIn contrast to other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words, and these may end in a wide variety of consonants, including some consonant clusters. Additionally, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, which gives rise to an abundance of such couplets as amic (\"male friend\") vs. amiga (\"female friend\").\n\nCentral Catalan pronunciation is considered to be standard for the language. The descriptions below are mostly representative of this variety.[85] For the differences in pronunciation between the different dialects, see the section on pronunciation of dialects in this article.\n\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, with the exception of Spanish. Balearic also has instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ, e/.\n\nIn Central Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > [ə]; /o, ɔ, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. The other dialects have different vowel reduction processes (see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article).\n\nThe consonant system of Catalan is rather conservative.\n• has a velarized allophone in syllable coda position in most dialects. However, is velarized irrespective of position in Eastern dialects such as Majorcan and standard Eastern Catalan.\n• occurs in Balearic, Algherese, standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia. It has merged with elsewhere.\n• Voiced stops become lenited to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: > , > , > . Exceptions include after lateral consonants, and after . In coda position, these sounds are realized as stops, 100 except in some Valencian dialects where they are lenited.\n• There is some confusion in the literature about the precise phonetic characteristics of , , , . Some sources describe them as \"postalveolar\". Others as \"back alveolo-palatal\", implying that the characters ⟨ ⟩ would be more accurate. However, in all literature only the characters for palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives are used, even when the same sources use ⟨ ⟩ for other languages such as Polish and Chinese. 104 105\n• The distribution of the two rhotics and closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast, but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset of the first syllable in a word, appears unless preceded by a consonant. Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring and Central Catalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case appears.\n• In careful speech, , , may be geminated. Geminated may also occur. Some analyze intervocalic as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme. This is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics. 108\n• Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, except Spanish and Sardinian.\n• Lenition of voiced stops as in Galician and Spanish.\n• Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician, Sardinian and Portuguese, and unlike French, Spanish and Italian.\n• Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.\n• Abundance of and occurring at the end of words, as for instance moll (\"wet\") and any (\"year\"), unlike Spanish, Portuguese or Italian.\n\nIn contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic ('male friend') vs. amiga ('female friend').\n\nCatalan sociolinguistics studies the situation of Catalan in the world and the different varieties that this language presents. It is a subdiscipline of Catalan philology and other affine studies and has as an objective to analyze the relation between the Catalan language, the speakers and the close reality (including the one of other languages in contact).\n• Variations of Catalan by class, gender, profession, age and level of studies\n• Relations between Catalan and Spanish or French\n• Perception on the language of Catalan speakers and non-speakers\n• Presence of Catalan in several fields: tagging, public function, media, professional sectors\n\nThe dialects of the Catalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%.[1] The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Algherese dialect.\n\nCatalan is split in two major dialectal blocks: Eastern and Western. The main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e; which have merged to /ə/ in Eastern dialects, but which remain distinct as /a/ and /e/ in Western dialects. There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.\n\nWestern Catalan comprises the two dialects of North-Western Catalan and Valencian; the Eastern block comprises four dialects: Central Catalan, Balearic, Roussillonese, and Algherese. Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects. The terms \"Catalan\" and \"Valencian\" (respectively used in Catalonia and the Valencian Community) refer to two varieties of the same language.[116] There are two institutions regulating the two standard varieties, the Institute of Catalan Studies in Catalonia and the Valencian Academy of the Language in the Valencian Community.\n\nCentral Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the largest number of speakers. It is spoken in the densely populated regions of the Barcelona province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.\n\nCatalan has an inflectional grammar. Nouns have two genders (masculine, feminine), and two numbers (singular, plural). Pronouns additionally can have a neuter gender, and some are also inflected for case and politeness, and can be combined in very complex ways. Verbs are split in several paradigms and are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and gender. In terms of pronunciation, Catalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other Romance languages.\n\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish. Balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ e/.\n\nIn Eastern Catalan (except Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > [ə]; /o, ɔ, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. There are a few instances of unreduced [e], [o] in some words. Algherese has lowered [ə] to [a].\n\nIn Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a, e, ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however /o, ɔ/ reduce to [o], with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan.\n\nIn Western Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: /e, ɛ/ > [e]; /o, ɔ/ > [o]; /a, u, i/ remain distinct. This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese. Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.\n\nCentral, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed /e/ and /ɛ/. Usually, words with /ɛ/ in Central Catalan correspond to /ə/ in Balearic and /e/ in Western Catalan. Words with /e/ in Balearic almost always have /e/ in Central and Western Catalan as well.[vague] As a result, Central Catalan has a much higher incidence of /ɛ/.\n\nCatalan dialects are characterized by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition and voicing assimilation. Additionally, many dialects contrast two rhotics (/r, ɾ/) and two laterals ((/l, ʎ/).\n\nMost Catalan dialects are also renowned by the usage of dark l (i.e. velarization of /l/ → [ɫ]), which is especially noticeable in syllable final position, in comparison to neighbouring languages, such as Spanish, Italian and French (that lack this pronunciation).\n\nThere is dialectal variation in regard to:\n• The pronunciation and distribution of sibilants (with different results according to voicing and affrication vs. deaffrication).\n• While, arguably there are seven to eight sibilants in Standard Catalan and Standard Valencian, dialects like Central Valencian and Ribagorçan only have three or four.\n• The usage of the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme .\n• The pronunciation or not of yod ( ) in the digraph .\n• The elision and pronunciation of final rhotics (either or ).\n• The delateralization of the palatal lateral approximant ( ).\n• The alternation of lenition vs. fortition (such as in 'village, people' → vs. vs. vs. vs. ).\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -e in verbs of the 1st conjugation and -∅ in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations in most of the Valencian Community, or -o in all verb conjugations in the Northern Valencian Community and Western Catalonia.\n\nE.g. parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western Catalan).\n\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -o, -i, or -∅ in all conjugations. \n\nE.g. parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), and parli (Northern), all meaning ('I speak').\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -isc/-esc, -ix, -ixen, -isca/-esca.\n\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.\n\nWestern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, maintenance of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.\n\nE.g. hòmens 'men', jóvens 'youth'.\n\nEastern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, loss of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.\n\nE.g. homes 'men', joves 'youth' (Ibicencan, however, follows the model of Western Catalan in this case[123]).\n\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nStandard Catalan, virtually accepted by all speakers, is mostly based on Eastern Catalan, which is the most widely used dialect. Nevertheless, the standards of the Valencian Community and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern Catalonia.\n\nThe most notable difference between both standards is some tonic ⟨e⟩ accentuation, for instance: francès, anglès (IEC) – francés, anglés (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent ⟨è⟩, while pronouncing it as /e/ rather than /ɛ/, in some words such as: què ('what'), or València. Other divergences include the use of ⟨tl⟩ (AVL) in some words instead of ⟨tll⟩ like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, such as subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('I buy').\n\nIn the Balearic Islands, IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the University of the Balearic Islands's philological section. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing'), but the university says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be cantam in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep').\n\nIn Alghero, the IEC has adapted its standard to the Algherese dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article lo instead of el, special possessive pronouns and determinants la mia ('mine'), lo sou/la sua ('his/her'), lo tou/la tua ('yours'), and so on, the use of -v- /v/ in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: cantava, creixiva, llegiva; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Algherese: manco instead of menys ('less'), calqui u instead of algú ('someone'), qual/quala instead of quin/quina ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of weak pronouns. In 1999, Catalan (Algherese dialect) was among the twelve minority languages officially recognized as Italy's \"historical linguistic minorities\" by the Italian State under Law No. 482/1999.[125]\n\nIn 2011,[126] the Aragonese government passed a decree approving the statutes of a new language regulator of Catalan in La Franja (the so-called Catalan-speaking areas of Aragon) as originally provided for by Law 10/2009.[127] The new entity, designated as Institut Aragonès del Català, shall allow a facultative education in Catalan and a standardization of the Catalan language in La Franja.\n\nValencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (provinces of Lleida and the western half of Tarragona). Central Catalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian.[1]\n\nLinguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian Community, the Valencian Academy of Language (Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) declares the linguistic unity between Valencian and Catalan varieties.[11]\n\nThe AVL, created by the Valencian parliament, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian, and its standard is based on the Norms of Castelló (Normes de Castelló). Currently, everyone who writes in Valencian uses this standard, except the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses an independent standard for Valencian.\n\nDespite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004[129] showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan. This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses for Valencian a standard independent from Catalan.[130]\n\nThis clash of opinions has sparked much controversy. For example, during the drafting of the European Constitution in 2004, the Spanish government supplied the EU with translations of the text into Basque, Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the latter two were identical.[131]\n\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nLiterary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there has been a tendency towards favoring words of Northern dialects to the detriment of others.\n\nLike other languages, Catalan has a large list of loanwords from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in Ramon Llull's work. In the 14th and 15th centuries Catalan had a far greater number of Greco-Latin loanwords than other Romance languages, as is attested for example in Roís de Corella's writings. The incorporation of learned, or \"bookish\" words from its own ancestor language, Latin, into Catalan is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Catalan speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Catalan.\n\nThe process of morphological derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages, where inflection is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctric [əˈlɛktri ] (\"electrical\") vs. electricitat [ələktri iˈtat]. Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, as in preveure (\"foresee\").\n\nThere is greater regularity in the process of word-compounding, where one can find compounded words formed much like those in English.\n\nCatalan uses the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs. The Catalan orthography is systematic and largely phonologically based. Standardization of Catalan was among the topics discussed during the First International Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC, founded in 1911) published the Normes ortogràfiques in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castelló de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called Normes de Castelló, a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra's Catalan language norms.[134]\n\nThe grammar of Catalan is similar to other Romance languages. Features include:\n• Use of definite and indefinite articles.\n• Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine), and number (singular and plural). There is no case inflexion, except in pronouns.\n• Verbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).\n• There are no modal auxiliaries.\n• Word order is freer than in English.\n\nIn gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian), the loss of the typical masculine suffix -o. Thus, the alternance of -o/-a, has been replaced by ø/-a. There are only a few exceptions, such as minso/minsa (\"scarce\"). Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, such as:\n• Loss of : / (\"flat\") vs. / (\"second\")\n\nCatalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has noi/noia (\"boy\"/\"girl\") and gall/gallina (\"cock\"/\"hen\"), whereas French has garçon/fille and coq/poule.\n\nThere is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favor of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta (\"boiling\") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.\n\nAs in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely. The most important one is the addition of -o- before certain consonant groups, a phonetic phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: el pols/els polsos (\"the pulse\"/\"the pulses\") vs. la pols/les pols (\"the dust\"/\"the dusts\").\n\nThe inflection of determinatives is complex, specially because of the high number of elisions, but is similar to the neighboring languages. Catalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, such as dels (\"of + the [plural]\"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).\n\nCentral Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favor of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian.\n\nThe morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, especially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian). Features include the gender-neutral ho and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).\n\nCatalan pronouns exhibit T–V distinction, like all other Romance languages (and most European languages, but not Modern English). This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.\n\nThis flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommandé à lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a él. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).\n\nLike all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.\n\nThe Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the synthetic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of anar (\"to go\") + infinitive.\n\nCatalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.\n\nThe grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is subject–verb–object.[142] However, word order is very flexible. Commonly, verb-subject constructions are used to achieve a semantic effect. The sentence \"The train has arrived\" could be translated as Ha arribat el tren or El tren ha arribat. Both sentences mean \"the train has arrived\", but the former puts a focus on the train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival. This subtle distinction is described as \"what you might say while waiting in the station\" versus \"what you might say on the train\".\n\nIn Spain, every person officially has two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname. The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the Catalan conjunction i (\"and\").[145]\n\nSelected text from Manuel de Pedrolo's 1970 novel Un amor fora ciutat (\"A love affair outside the city\").\n• Gramàtica Normativa Valenciana (Valencian grammar).

Anyway, I saw Police Academy in a packed cinema when it was first released, and the cinema burst into laughter big time. For those watching Police Academy on VHS, DVD or streaming, would you get the same laughs, I don't know I guess. Still, Police Academy is a classic although the sequels not so much.Police Academy (film) - Wikipedia: Police Academy is a 1984 American comedy film directed by Hugh Wilson in his directorial debut, and distributed by Warner Bros..[4] Its storyline follows a new recruitment policy for an unnamed city's police academy to take in any recruit who wishes to apply and study to become a police officer. The film stars Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall, and G. W. Bailey.\n\nThe film was produced by The Ladd Company. It premiered on March 23, 1984.[5] It grossed $8.5 million in its opening weekend and more than $149 million worldwide, against a budget of $4.8 million, and remains the most successful film of the series as of 2022.[3] The film spawned six sequels in the Police Academy franchise, and is the only film in the franchise to be rated R by the MPAA.\n\nIn an unnamed city, the mayor announces that the Metropolitan Police must accept all willing applicants for training, regardless of their suitability for the role. Hundreds of citizens, who never thought they could be police officers, apply: rich girl Karen Thompson; former criminal and human beatbox Larvell Jones; gentle giant Moses Hightower, gun fanatic Eugene Tackleberry; lothario George Martin; soft-spoken Laverne Hooks; accident-prone Douglas Fackler; and bullied Leslie Barbara. Rebellious underachiever, Carey Mahoney, arrested for yet another petty crime, is given a chance to escape prison time by Captain Reed, a friend of his father: enroll in the academy and complete training. Mahoney agrees, planning to misbehave and be forced out, but he learns from Commandant Eric Lassard that he cannot quit or be rejected until training is complete.\n\nDismayed at being forced to take undesirable recruits, Police chief Henry Hurst plots to make the training unbearable so they will willingly quit. Several cadets drop out while training under the ruthless Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris. Harris targets Mahoney, believing his behaviour is preventing him from training actual officers, but when given the chance to quit, Mahoney declines as he and Karen have developed a mutual attraction. Cadets Copeland and Blankes are chosen as squad leaders by Harris to help him torment Mahoney and spy on the other recruits. Copeland and Blankes investigate a party hosted by Mahoney, who uses Barbara to trick them into attending the Blue Oyster Bar, a gay biker bar, where they are intimidated into dancing with the patrons. In revenge, they hide a prostitute in Barbara's dorm room before a room inspection to get him expelled. Mahoney attempts to smuggle her off campus, but they are forced to hide under a lectern just as Lassard leads a presentation to a group of fellow officers. The prostitute covertly performs fellatio on Lassard while he is speaking, and when Lassard later sees Mahoney sneak out, he assumes Mahoney performed the act.\n\nHightower requests Mahoney's help in learning to drive before the cadet driving test. The pair steal Copeland's small, two-door Honda to practice in, evade a police pursuit, and leave it heavily damaged. Following Hightower's successful completion of the test, Copeland racially insults Laverne after she drives over his feet. Enraged, Hightower overturns a police cruiser with Copeland inside it, leading to his ejection from the academy, to the dismay of his fellow cadets. Copeland and Blankes attempt to make Mahoney fight them over Copeland's destroyed car, but he refuses, knowing they are trying to get him thrown out. Barbara stands up for Mahoney and strikes Copeland first, leading to a brawl. Harris threatens to eject Barbara, but Mahoney takes the blame to protect him and is expelled from the academy.\n\nMeanwhile, Fackler throws an apple from his police car during patrol, inadvertently striking a man who mistakenly assumes someone else is responsible, starting a fight which escalates into a city-wide riot. Before he can leave, Mahoney joins the deployed cadets to tackle the disorder, but they find themselves inadvertently transported into the center of the riots and heavily outnumbered. One criminal steals Blankes and Copeland's revolvers and takes Harris hostage on a rooftop. Mahoney tries to help, but the criminal threatens to kill Harris and Mahoney is forced to surrender. Hightower, having followed the chaos, arrives and deceives the criminal into thinking he is on his side, before throwing him down a flight of stairs where he is arrested by Laverne.\n\nAt the cadet graduation ceremony, Mahoney and Hightower have been reinstated to the academy and receive the highest commendations for their bravery. Mahoney prepares to give a speech, but it is revealed that Lassard has hidden the prostitute beneath the Lectern to take revenge on Mahoney.\n\nThe producers considered Michael Keaton, Tom Hanks, and Judge Reinhold for the role of Carey Mahoney.[6] Bruce Willis auditioned for the role of Carey Mahoney.[7]\n\nPaul Maslansky says he got the idea for the film when in San Francisco filming The Right Stuff:\n\nMaslansky said he wondered \"But what if they actually made it?\"[8] He took the idea to Alan Ladd Jr., who agreed to finance.[8] Neal Israel was hired to write the script with Pat Proft. Israel said:\n\nDom DeLuise was considered to direct the film but he was unavailable.[9] Hugh Wilson was hired as director based on his success with WKRP in Cincinnati, even though he was not familiar with many films of this genre. He then saw a lot of those sort. saying \"it was fairly discouraging. This immediately convinced me to cut down on the sleaze. I asked for, and got, the power to refine the Israel-Proft script. Maintaining that 'funny is money,' I wanted to go for real laughter rather than going for the elements such as gratuitous sex and anti-Establishment exploits. I wanted jokes which were rooted in reality.\"[8]\n\nMaslansky says Wilson \"took a lot of the vulgarity out; some of the very things I considered necessary. I worried that it was becoming more homogenized, and I told Hugh, \"Let's keep some of the flatulence in.\"[8]\n\nWilson says \"I found out that the shower scene, the party scene, and the fellatio scene were obligatory; I had to put them in. So I was stuck with trying to make those scenes as artistic as possible.\"[8]\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, about \"20 of the major elements in the movie\" remain from the Israel and Proft version. Israel says that when Wilson and Maslansky turned in their rewrite to the Ladd Company, \"it was rejected and the project was almost shelved. Only when they put back in dozens of our gags did the project get the go ahead.\"[8]\n\nSome of the scenes Wilson was unhappy with included the fellatio scene and the scene where a police sergeant was hurled into the backside of a horse. A compromise was reached where these acts were not actually directly shown.[8]\n\n\"I realize that you can carry grossness, rudeness, and crudeness just so far before the audience finds it terribly repetitive and not so funny,\" said Wilson. \"After the enormous success of Police Academy, I no longer believe that you have to show the female breast or make cruel ethnic jokes, not to mention the rampant sexism. And you don't have to reproduce the sounds that an overfed body makes.\"[8]\n\nOpening scenes were shot in Toronto, Ontario. The camera booth scene was shot on the Cherry Street Bridge in Toronto.[10] The academy itself was previously the site of the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital in Etobicoke, and has since become the Lakeshore campus of Humber College.[11] The studio scenes were shot at Lakeshore Film Studios; the city scenes were filmed in various parts of Toronto.[12] The riot scenes was filmed at Kensington Market in Toronto.

Suspects wanted for mugging the camera [...] with the intent to incite a laugh riot. Please respond to this blues burlesque, a uniformly funny hit sure to have a long run.

The film tells the story of a young Jewish girl who, after being separated from her father in Soviet Russia, grows up in England and moves to Paris as a young adult, shortly before the beginning of World War II. It is the last film worked on by the French cinematographer Sacha Vierny.\n\nFegele Abramovich (Christina Ricci), a Russian Jew is separated from her father (Oleg Yankovsky) as a child in 1927. Her father has travelled to America to seek his fortune and plans to send for Fegele and her grandmother. Before leaving, he sings \"Je Crois Entendre Encore\" from the Bizet opera Les pêcheurs de perles to her. After her father leaves, the village is attacked and burned in a pogrom. Fegele escapes with the help of neighbours; after overcoming many obstacles, she is crowded onto a boat headed for Britain, with only a photo of her father and a coin given to her by her grandmother.\n\nUpon arrival, an English official renames her \"Susan\" and places her with foster parents. English students at school taunt her by calling her a \"gypsy\", but she does not yet understand English. A teacher at the school overhears her singing \"Je Crois Entendre Encore\" in Yiddish, and teaches her to sing and speak in English.\n\nTime passes, and Suzie auditions for a singing dance troupe heading for Paris. There, she meets an older Russian dancer named Lola (Cate Blanchett), and they share an apartment as friends. At a formal party, both women perform as dancers alongside a mysterious performing horseman, Cesar (Johnny Depp), a Romani to whom Suzie is attracted. After their performance outside, they overhear a tenor inside singing \"Je Crois Entendre Encore\"; the voice belongs to Dante (John Turturro), an Italian opera singer who immediately catches Lola's eye. Lola works her way into his good graces and falls for his charms, enticed by his wealth and success. Dante, Lola, Suzie, and Cesar all work for an opera company directed by Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton). Dante is an imperious follower of Mussolini; this alienates him from Suzie even as he becomes Lola's lover. Meanwhile, Cesar introduces Suzie to his \"family\" (essentially his entire tribe), and they fall in love.\n\nOne day, Dante is rifling through Suzie's things after a dalliance with Lola in the apartment, and deduces her Jewish heritage after finding her father's photo. An elderly Jewish neighbour downstairs, Madame Goldstein (Miriam Karlin), also knows that Suzie is Jewish and has warned her of the dangers on the horizon as the Germans invade Poland. The following year, as the Germans invade France and approach Paris, an exodus begins of Jews and other people threatened by Nazism. Crowds for the operatic show dwindle, and eventually the only cast members left are Dante and Suzie. When Dante attempts to seduce Suzie, she rebuffs him. He lashes out at her for her heritage and her relationship with Cesar, whose heritage he also scorns. Perlman comes to her defence; he reminds Dante that as an Italian in Paris at that time, should Mussolini align with the Nazis, Dante's own position in Paris would be precarious. Perlman closes down the show; the Nazis enter Paris the following morning.\n\nDante reluctantly returns to his earlier role as minstrel. After another rebuff from Suzie, Dante reveals to a German officer that Suzie is a Jew. Lola overhears this and informs Suzie that she is in danger and must leave Paris. Lola has also decided to leave Dante and has purchased tickets for Suzie and herself on an ocean liner headed for America. The same night of the party, the Nazis attack the Romani village and kill a child. When Cesar comes to her apartment to say goodbye, Suzie expresses her desire to stay and help Cesar fight the Nazis for his family, but he tells her she must flee and find her father. They share a tender last evening together.\n\nDuring the ocean passage the liner is torpedoed, with Lola killed in the sinking. Suzie is among the survivors rescued and brought to New York.\n\nSuzie searches for her father and discovers that he changed his name, gave up singing, and moved west after hearing about the attack on his home village, which he assumed killed all the members of his family. Suzie goes to Hollywood where her father has established himself into a studio head, and discovers he has a new family and that he is dying. She goes to the hospital, walks past his new wife and children who are waiting outside the door to his room, and is reunited with her father. He recognizes her and expresses joy at her appearance. She sits on the side of his bed and sings \"Je Crois Entendre Encore\" to him in Yiddish as tears roll down his face.\n\nThe singing voices for the characters of Dante and Suzie were provided by Salvatore Licitra and Iva Bittova, respectively.[5]\n\nThe film was first presented at the Venice Film Festival on 2 September 2000. The film screened at the London Film Festival; the Mar del Plata Film Festival, Argentina; the Tokyo International Film Festival & the Reykjavik Film Festival, Iceland among others.\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews, currently holding a 35% 'rotten' rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes. The consensus, based on 69 reviews, says 'The storyline is overwrought and awkward, and the audience is distanced from the flatly drawn characters.'[6] Metacritic calculated an average score of 40 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[7]\n\nThe Man Who Cried: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released 22 May 2001. It features new music composed by Osvaldo Golijov, and was produced by Sally Potter and performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra Covent Garden, Salvatore Licitra, and Taraf de Haïdouks.[8]\n• The Man Who Cried at IMDb\n• The Man Who Cried at Rotten Tomatoes\n• The Man Who Cried at Box Office MojoThe Man Who Cried (2000) ⭐ 6.1 | Drama, Music, Romance: I did not know what to expect when I watched this film. What I did not anticipate, was that it would be so poignantly moving...very few films can actually reach out and involve the viewer to such an extent. There are many words that come to mind - haunting, sad, sweet, poetic...yet none of them capture the true essence of The Man Who Cried.\n\n\n\nSally Potter has done a wonderful job. This film suggests - it never really comes out and blatantly states. The scene with Cate Blanchette in the swimming pool is particularly beautiful. This film is so visually appealing - the graceful lines, the shadows, the colours...and that wonderful haunting music. Ms. Potter takes you into the minds of her characters, while the story floats and drifts around you in a collage of beautiful rich tones. She doesn't attempt to conceal the ugly face of war, but does not depict explicit violence as so many other directors do.\n\n\n\nJohnny Depp and Christina Ricci are perfectly cast - unusual roles for both. They bring depth, intensity and meaning to their characters. Unlike Sleepy Hollow, this film is gentle and strong at once, while retaining something of the same gothic charm. Cate Balnchette also surprised me with her very unusual portrayal of Lola.\n\n\n\nI would watch this movie all over again...and again...and again!Reddit - Dive into anything: I got the miscellaneous objective from the inn but the man I’m supposed to speak with has no option regarding the quest. Any help?\n\nEDIT: Nothing seems to help but I found an interesting letter when pickpocketing Falk Firebeard. It is directed to me and it says: ”Over the last few days we’ve had some disturbing information come to light regarding the events at Wolfskull Cave and the summoning and binding ritual you interrupted there.\n\nGiven your involvement with that event I’m asking you to return to Solitude to help us once more. I’m wary of putting all the details in print, please come see me at The Blue Palace.\n\nShould I load a previous save before pickpocketing the letter and wait for a courier to bring it to me? I should mention that no new objective appeared after reading the letter and I’ve never been to Wolfskull Cave before.\n\nEDIT 2: Problem solved. Thank you for the replies. For anyone else having the same problem: I downloaded a USSEP patch mod and after that I started the civil war questline, sided with the stormcloacks and did as many quests as I could. Now the dialogue started at the blue palace.The Man Who Cried (TV Movie 1993) ⭐ 6.7 | Drama: Let me start by saying Catherine Cookson was a very popular British novelist who sold something like 100 million books during her career. If her books had been like this boiler plate TV production she would not have sold 100 books. \n\n\n\nHere is the story: A man abruptly leaves a failed marriage and travels with his son to Northern England where he eventually has to marry again (and thus commit bigamy). Wife finds him....soap twists and turns abound--second wife Hilda discovers she is not her father's daughter etc etc....\n\n\n\nThe first half is by far the best...the boy Dick is played by a charismatic child actor he makes the first half. The second half of the series is lousy from the 2 dimensional rendition of war time England to just the way the screen writers condensed and parsed the novel--a common problem with book/movies.\n\n\n\nAnother problem for me was the Appalachian type sound track...it is incongruous to the location.\n\n\n\nThis is an over dramatized soap with below average production values. I blame the writers and a couple miscast characters.\n\n\n\nOne measure I have of soaps is if they make make me care about the characters... in the second half of this film I grew to dislike all of them.

It is the official language of Andorra, and an official language of three autonomous communities in eastern Spain: Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community, where it is called Valencian (valencià). It has semi-official status in the Italian comune of Alghero,[3] and it is spoken in the Pyrénées-Orientales department of France and in two further areas in eastern Spain: the eastern strip of Aragon and the Carche area in the Region of Murcia. The Catalan-speaking territories are often called the Països Catalans or \"Catalan Countries\".[4]\n\nThe language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees. Nineteenth-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, culminating in the early 1900s.\n\nThe word Catalan is derived from the territorial name of Catalonia, itself of disputed etymology. The main theory suggests that Catalunya (Latin: Gathia Launia) derives from the name Gothia or Gauthia ('Land of the Goths'), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania > Catalonia theoretically derived.\n\nIn English, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as Catelaner, followed in the 15th century as Catellain (from Middle French). It is attested a language name since at least 1652. The word Catalan can be pronounced in English as KAT-ə-lən, -⁠lan or KAT-ə-LAN.[9][10]\n\nThe endonym is pronounced [kətəˈla] in the Eastern Catalan dialects, and [kataˈla] in the Western dialects. In the Valencian Community and Carche, the term valencià [valensiˈa] is frequently used instead. Thus, the name \"Valencian\", although often employed for referring to the varieties specific to the Valencian Community and Carche, is also used by Valencians as a name for the language as a whole,[11] synonymous with \"Catalan\".[11] Both uses of the term have their respective entries in the dictionaries by the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL)[note 1] and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC).[note 2] (See also status of Valencian below).\n\nBy the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees, as well as the territories of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis to the south. From the 8th century onwards the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards at the expense of the Muslims, bringing their language with them. This process was given definitive impetus with the separation of the County of Barcelona from the Carolingian Empire in 988.\n\nIn the 11th century, documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show Catalan elements, with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080. Old Catalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance, diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries.\n\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries the Catalan rulers expanded southward to the Ebro river, and in the 13th century they conquered the lands that would become the Kingdoms of Valencia and the Majorca. The city of Alghero in Sardinia was repopulated with Catalan speakers in the 14th century. The language also reached Murcia, which became Spanish-speaking in the 15th century.\n\nIn the Low Middle Ages, Catalan went through a golden age, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness. Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232–1315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th–14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March (1397–1459). By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon, and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world. During this period, the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language. Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th. During this period, the language was what Costa Carreras terms \"one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe\".\n\nMartorell's novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490) shows a transition from Medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in Metge's work. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.[16]\n\nWith the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon in 1479, the Spanish kings ruled over different kingdoms, each with its own cultural, linguistic and political particularities, and they had to swear by the laws of each territory before the respective parliaments. But after the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain became an absolute monarchy under Philip V, which led to the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Crown of Castile through the Nueva Planta decrees, as a first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state; as in other contemporary European states, this meant the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant groups.[18][19] Since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards national minorities have been a constant.[20][21][22][23][24][neutrality is disputed]\n\nThe process of assimilation began with secret instructions to the corregidores of the Catalan territory: they \"will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed\".[25] From there, actions in the service of assimilation, discreet or aggressive, were continued, and reached to the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal Certificate forbidding anyone to \"represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish\".[25] The use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the decline of Catalan. Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the nobles, part of the urban and literary classes became bilingual.\n\nWith the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Spain ceded the northern part of Catalonia to France, and soon thereafter the local Catalan varieties came under the influence of French, which in 1700 became the sole official language of the region.[26]\n\nShortly after the French Revolution (1789), the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the regional languages of France, such as Catalan, Alsatian, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque.\n\nAfter the French colony of Algeria was established in 1830, many Catalan-speaking settlers moved there. People from the Spanish province of Alicante settled around Oran, while those from French Catalonia and Menorca migrated to Algiers.\n\nBy 1911, there were around 100,000 speakers of Patuet,[27] as their speech was called.[28] After the Algerian declaration of independence in 1962, almost all the Pied-Noir Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia[29] or Alicante.\n\nThe French government only recognizes French as an official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the then General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales officially recognized Catalan as one of the départment's languages[31] and seeks to further promote it in public life and education.\n\nIn 1807, the Statistics Office of the French Ministry of the Interior asked the prefects for an official survey on the limits of the French language. The survey found that in Roussillon, almost only Catalan was spoken, and since Napoleon wanted to incorporate Catalonia into France, as happened in 1812, the consul in Barcelona was also asked. He declared that Catalan \"is taught in schools, it is printed and spoken, not only among the lower class, but also among people of first quality, also in social gatherings, as in visits and congresses\", indicating that it was spoken everywhere \"with the exception of the royal courts\". He also indicated that Catalan was spoken \"in the Kingdom of Valencia, in the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Sardinia, Corsica and much of Sicily, in the Vall d \"Aran and Cerdaña\".[32]\n\nThe defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) initiated a series of laws which, among other centralizing measures, imposed the use of Spanish in legal documentation all over Spain. Because of this, use of the Catalan language declined into the 18th century.\n\nHowever, the 19th century saw a Catalan literary revival (Renaixença), which has continued up to the present day. This period starts with Aribau's Ode to the Homeland (1833); followed in the second half of the 19th century, and the early 20th by the work of Verdaguer (poetry), Oller (realist novel), and Guimerà (drama). In the 19th century, the region of Carche, in the province of Murcia was repopulated with Valencian speakers. Catalan spelling was standardized in 1913 and the language became official during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). The Second Spanish Republic saw a brief period of tolerance, with most restrictions against Catalan lifted. The Generalitat (the autonomous government of Catalonia, established during the Republic in 1931) made a normal use of Catalan in its administration and put efforts to promote it at the social level, including in schools and the University of Barcelona.\n\nThe Catalan language and culture were still vibrant during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), but were crushed at an unprecedented level throughout the subsequent decades due to Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), which abolished the official status of Catalan and imposed the use of Spanish in schools and in public administration in all of Spain, while banning the use of Catalan in them.[35] Between 1939 and 1943 newspapers and book printing in Catalan almost disappeared.[36] Francisco Franco's desire for a homogeneous Spanish population resonated with some Catalans in favor of his regime, primarily members of the upper class, who began to reject the use of Catalan. Despite all of these hardships, Catalan continued to be used privately within households, and it was able to survive Franco's dictatorship. At the end of World War II, however, some of the harsh measures began to be lifted and, while Spanish language remained the sole promoted one, limited number of Catalan literature began to be tolerated. Several prominent Catalan authors resisted the suppression through literature.[37] Private initiative contests were created to reward works in Catalan, among them Joan Martorell prize (1947), Víctor Català prize (1953) Carles Riba award (1950), or the Honor Award of Catalan Letters (1969).[38] The first Catalan-language TV show was broadcast in 1964.[39] At the same time, oppression of the Catalan language and identity was carried out in schools, through governmental bodies, and in religious centers.[40]\n\nIn addition to the loss of prestige for Catalan and its prohibition in schools, migration during the 1950s into Catalonia from other parts of Spain also contributed to the diminished use of the language. These migrants were often unaware of the existence of Catalan, and thus felt no need to learn or use it. Catalonia was the economic powerhouse of Spain, so these migrations continued to occur from all corners of the country. Employment opportunities were reduced for those who were not bilingual.[41] Daily newspapers remained exclusively in Spanish until after Franco's death, when the first one in Catalan since the end of the Civil War, Avui, began to be published in 1976.[42]\n\nSince the Spanish transition to democracy (1975–1982), Catalan has been institutionalized as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige. In Catalonia, there is an unparalleled large bilingual European non-state linguistic community. The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools, but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia in two situations—if the teacher assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish, or during the learning process of one or more recently arrived immigrant students.[44] There is also some intergenerational shift towards Catalan.\n\nMore recently, several Spanish political forces have tried to increase the use of Spanish in the Catalan educational system.[45] As a result, in May 2022 the Spanish Supreme Court urged the Catalan regional government to enforce a measure by which 25% of all lessons must be taught in Spanish.[46]\n\nAccording to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia, in 2013 the Catalan language is the second most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language: 7% of the population self-identifies with both Catalan and Spanish equally, 36.4% with Catalan and 47.5% only Spanish.[47] In 2003 the same studies concluded no language preference for self-identification within the population above 15 years old: 5% self-identified with both languages, 44.3% with Catalan and 47.5% with Spanish.[48] To promote use of Catalan, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia's official Autonomous government) spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories, with entities such as Consorci per a la Normalització Lingüística [ca; es] (Consortium for Linguistic Normalization).[49][50]\n\nIn Andorra, Catalan has always been the sole official language. Since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several policies favoring Catalan have been enforced, such as Catalan medium education.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In the Northern Catalonia area of France, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004). Catalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary. The cultural association La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in Catalan language immersion programs.\n\nIn Alicante province, Catalan is being replaced by Spanish and in Alghero by Italian. There is also well ingrained diglossia in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.\n\nDuring the 20th century many Catalans emigrated or went into exile to Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, and other South American countries. They formed a large number of Catalan colonies that today continue to maintain the Catalan language.[51] They also founded many Catalan casals (associations).[52]\n\nOne classification of Catalan is given by Pèire Bèc:\n\nHowever, the ascription of Catalan to the Occitano-Romance branch of Gallo-Romance languages is not shared by all linguists and philologists, particularly among Spanish ones, such as Ramón Menéndez Pidal.\n\nCatalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.\n\nSome include Catalan in Occitan, as the linguistic distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon dialect) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century[53] and still today remains its closest relative.[54]\n\nCatalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, French, Italian, Sardinian as well as Spanish and Portuguese among others). However, despite being spoken mostly on the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan has marked differences with the Iberian Romance group (Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and especially vocabulary; it shows instead its closest affinity with languages native to France and northern Italy, particularly Occitan and to a lesser extent Gallo-Romance (Franco-Provençal, French, Gallo-Italian).[58]\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between Catalan and other Romance languages is: 87% with Italian; 85% with Portuguese and Spanish; 76% with Ladin and Romansh; 75% with Sardinian; and 73% with Romanian.[1]\n\nDuring much of its history, and especially during the Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), the Catalan language was ridiculed as a mere dialect of Spanish. This view, based on political and ideological considerations, has no linguistic validity. Spanish and Catalan have important differences in their sound systems, lexicon, and grammatical features, placing the language in features closer to Occitan (and French).\n\nThere is evidence that, at least from the 2nd century AD, the vocabulary and phonology of Roman Tarraconensis was different from the rest of Roman Hispania. Differentiation arose generally because Spanish, Asturian, and Galician-Portuguese share certain peripheral archaisms (Spanish hervir, Asturian and Portuguese ferver vs. Catalan bullir, Occitan bolir \"to boil\") and innovatory regionalisms (Spanish novillo, Asturian nuviellu vs. Catalan torell, Occitan taurèl \"bullock\"), while Catalan has a shared history with the Western Romance innovative core, especially Occitan.\n\nLike all Romance languages, Catalan has a handful of native words which are unique to it, or rare elsewhere. These include:\n• verbs: 'to fasten; transfix' > 'to compose, write up', > 'to combine, conjugate', > 'to wake; awaken', 'to thicken; crowd together' > 'to save, keep', > 'to miss, yearn, pine for', 'to investigate, track' > Old Catalan enagar 'to incite, induce', > Old Catalan ujar 'to exhaust, fatigue', > 'to appease, mollify', > 'to reject, refuse';\n\nThe Gothic superstrate produced different outcomes in Spanish and Catalan. For example, Catalan fang \"mud\" and rostir \"to roast\", of Germanic origin, contrast with Spanish lodo and asar, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan filosa \"spinning wheel\" and templa \"temple\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish rueca and sien, of Germanic origin.\n\nThe same happens with Arabic loanwords. Thus, Catalan alfàbia \"large earthenware jar\" and rajola \"tile\", of Arabic origin, contrast with Spanish tinaja and teja, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan oli \"oil\" and oliva \"olive\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish aceite and aceituna. However, the Arabic element is generally much more prevalent in Spanish.\n\nSituated between two large linguistic blocks (Iberian Romance and Gallo-Romance), Catalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar \"to miss somebody\", apaivagar \"to calm somebody down\", and rebutjar \"reject\".\n\nTraditionally Catalan-speaking territories are sometimes called the Països Catalans (Catalan Countries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status. Various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions.\n\nThe number of people known to be fluent in Catalan varies depending on the sources used. A 2004 study did not count the total number of speakers, but estimated a total of 9–9.5 million by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where Catalan is spoken.[69] The web site of the Generalitat de Catalunya estimated that as of 2004 there were 9,118,882 speakers of Catalan.[70] These figures only reflect potential speakers; today it is the native language of only 35.6% of the Catalan population.[71] According to Ethnologue, Catalan had 4.1 million native speakers and 5.1 million second-language speakers in 2021.[1]\n\nAccording to a 2011 study the total number of Catalan speakers was over 9.8 million, with 5.9 million residing in Catalonia. More than half of them spoke Catalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in Catalonia).[72] Very few Catalan monoglots exist; virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with 99.7% of Catalan speakers in Catalonia able to speak Spanish and 99.9% able to understand it.[73]\n\nIn Roussillon, only a minority of French Catalans speak Catalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of language shift. According to a 2019 survey by the Catalan government, 31.5% of the inhabitants of Catalonia predominantly spoke Catalan at home whereas 52.7% spoke Spanish, 2.8% both Catalan and Spanish and 10.8% other languages.[74]\n\nSpanish was the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. According to 2013 census, Catalan was also very commonly spoken in the city of 1,501,262: it was understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% over the age of two could speak it (1,137,816), 79% could read it (1,246.555), and 53% could write it (835,080).[75] The share of Barcelona residents who could speak it (72.3%)[76] was lower than that of the overall Catalan population, of whom 81.2% over the age of 15 spoke the language. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. An important social characteristic of the Catalan language is that all the areas where it is spoken are bilingual in practice: together with French in Roussillon, with Italian in Alghero, with Spanish and French in Andorra, and with Spanish in the rest of the territories.\n\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n• Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, other than Spanish.\n• Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician and Portuguese, but unlike French, Spanish, or Italian.\n• Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.\n\nIn contrast to other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words, and these may end in a wide variety of consonants, including some consonant clusters. Additionally, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, which gives rise to an abundance of such couplets as amic (\"male friend\") vs. amiga (\"female friend\").\n\nCentral Catalan pronunciation is considered to be standard for the language. The descriptions below are mostly representative of this variety.[85] For the differences in pronunciation between the different dialects, see the section on pronunciation of dialects in this article.\n\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, with the exception of Spanish. Balearic also has instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ, e/.\n\nIn Central Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > [ə]; /o, ɔ, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. The other dialects have different vowel reduction processes (see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article).\n\nThe consonant system of Catalan is rather conservative.\n• has a velarized allophone in syllable coda position in most dialects. However, is velarized irrespective of position in Eastern dialects such as Majorcan and standard Eastern Catalan.\n• occurs in Balearic, Algherese, standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia. It has merged with elsewhere.\n• Voiced stops become lenited to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: > , > , > . Exceptions include after lateral consonants, and after . In coda position, these sounds are realized as stops, 100 except in some Valencian dialects where they are lenited.\n• There is some confusion in the literature about the precise phonetic characteristics of , , , . Some sources describe them as \"postalveolar\". Others as \"back alveolo-palatal\", implying that the characters ⟨ ⟩ would be more accurate. However, in all literature only the characters for palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives are used, even when the same sources use ⟨ ⟩ for other languages such as Polish and Chinese. 104 105\n• The distribution of the two rhotics and closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast, but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset of the first syllable in a word, appears unless preceded by a consonant. Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring and Central Catalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case appears.\n• In careful speech, , , may be geminated. Geminated may also occur. Some analyze intervocalic as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme. This is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics. 108\n• Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, except Spanish and Sardinian.\n• Lenition of voiced stops as in Galician and Spanish.\n• Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician, Sardinian and Portuguese, and unlike French, Spanish and Italian.\n• Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.\n• Abundance of and occurring at the end of words, as for instance moll (\"wet\") and any (\"year\"), unlike Spanish, Portuguese or Italian.\n\nIn contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic ('male friend') vs. amiga ('female friend').\n\nCatalan sociolinguistics studies the situation of Catalan in the world and the different varieties that this language presents. It is a subdiscipline of Catalan philology and other affine studies and has as an objective to analyze the relation between the Catalan language, the speakers and the close reality (including the one of other languages in contact).\n• Variations of Catalan by class, gender, profession, age and level of studies\n• Relations between Catalan and Spanish or French\n• Perception on the language of Catalan speakers and non-speakers\n• Presence of Catalan in several fields: tagging, public function, media, professional sectors\n\nThe dialects of the Catalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%.[1] The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Algherese dialect.\n\nCatalan is split in two major dialectal blocks: Eastern and Western. The main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e; which have merged to /ə/ in Eastern dialects, but which remain distinct as /a/ and /e/ in Western dialects. There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.\n\nWestern Catalan comprises the two dialects of North-Western Catalan and Valencian; the Eastern block comprises four dialects: Central Catalan, Balearic, Roussillonese, and Algherese. Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects. The terms \"Catalan\" and \"Valencian\" (respectively used in Catalonia and the Valencian Community) refer to two varieties of the same language.[116] There are two institutions regulating the two standard varieties, the Institute of Catalan Studies in Catalonia and the Valencian Academy of the Language in the Valencian Community.\n\nCentral Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the largest number of speakers. It is spoken in the densely populated regions of the Barcelona province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.\n\nCatalan has an inflectional grammar. Nouns have two genders (masculine, feminine), and two numbers (singular, plural). Pronouns additionally can have a neuter gender, and some are also inflected for case and politeness, and can be combined in very complex ways. Verbs are split in several paradigms and are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and gender. In terms of pronunciation, Catalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other Romance languages.\n\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish. Balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ e/.\n\nIn Eastern Catalan (except Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > [ə]; /o, ɔ, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. There are a few instances of unreduced [e], [o] in some words. Algherese has lowered [ə] to [a].\n\nIn Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a, e, ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however /o, ɔ/ reduce to [o], with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan.\n\nIn Western Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: /e, ɛ/ > [e]; /o, ɔ/ > [o]; /a, u, i/ remain distinct. This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese. Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.\n\nCentral, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed /e/ and /ɛ/. Usually, words with /ɛ/ in Central Catalan correspond to /ə/ in Balearic and /e/ in Western Catalan. Words with /e/ in Balearic almost always have /e/ in Central and Western Catalan as well.[vague] As a result, Central Catalan has a much higher incidence of /ɛ/.\n\nCatalan dialects are characterized by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition and voicing assimilation. Additionally, many dialects contrast two rhotics (/r, ɾ/) and two laterals ((/l, ʎ/).\n\nMost Catalan dialects are also renowned by the usage of dark l (i.e. velarization of /l/ → [ɫ]), which is especially noticeable in syllable final position, in comparison to neighbouring languages, such as Spanish, Italian and French (that lack this pronunciation).\n\nThere is dialectal variation in regard to:\n• The pronunciation and distribution of sibilants (with different results according to voicing and affrication vs. deaffrication).\n• While, arguably there are seven to eight sibilants in Standard Catalan and Standard Valencian, dialects like Central Valencian and Ribagorçan only have three or four.\n• The usage of the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme .\n• The pronunciation or not of yod ( ) in the digraph .\n• The elision and pronunciation of final rhotics (either or ).\n• The delateralization of the palatal lateral approximant ( ).\n• The alternation of lenition vs. fortition (such as in 'village, people' → vs. vs. vs. vs. ).\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -e in verbs of the 1st conjugation and -∅ in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations in most of the Valencian Community, or -o in all verb conjugations in the Northern Valencian Community and Western Catalonia.\n\nE.g. parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western Catalan).\n\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -o, -i, or -∅ in all conjugations. \n\nE.g. parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), and parli (Northern), all meaning ('I speak').\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -isc/-esc, -ix, -ixen, -isca/-esca.\n\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.\n\nWestern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, maintenance of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.\n\nE.g. hòmens 'men', jóvens 'youth'.\n\nEastern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, loss of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.\n\nE.g. homes 'men', joves 'youth' (Ibicencan, however, follows the model of Western Catalan in this case[123]).\n\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nStandard Catalan, virtually accepted by all speakers, is mostly based on Eastern Catalan, which is the most widely used dialect. Nevertheless, the standards of the Valencian Community and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern Catalonia.\n\nThe most notable difference between both standards is some tonic ⟨e⟩ accentuation, for instance: francès, anglès (IEC) – francés, anglés (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent ⟨è⟩, while pronouncing it as /e/ rather than /ɛ/, in some words such as: què ('what'), or València. Other divergences include the use of ⟨tl⟩ (AVL) in some words instead of ⟨tll⟩ like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, such as subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('I buy').\n\nIn the Balearic Islands, IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the University of the Balearic Islands's philological section. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing'), but the university says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be cantam in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep').\n\nIn Alghero, the IEC has adapted its standard to the Algherese dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article lo instead of el, special possessive pronouns and determinants la mia ('mine'), lo sou/la sua ('his/her'), lo tou/la tua ('yours'), and so on, the use of -v- /v/ in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: cantava, creixiva, llegiva; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Algherese: manco instead of menys ('less'), calqui u instead of algú ('someone'), qual/quala instead of quin/quina ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of weak pronouns. In 1999, Catalan (Algherese dialect) was among the twelve minority languages officially recognized as Italy's \"historical linguistic minorities\" by the Italian State under Law No. 482/1999.[125]\n\nIn 2011,[126] the Aragonese government passed a decree approving the statutes of a new language regulator of Catalan in La Franja (the so-called Catalan-speaking areas of Aragon) as originally provided for by Law 10/2009.[127] The new entity, designated as Institut Aragonès del Català, shall allow a facultative education in Catalan and a standardization of the Catalan language in La Franja.\n\nValencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (provinces of Lleida and the western half of Tarragona). Central Catalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian.[1]\n\nLinguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian Community, the Valencian Academy of Language (Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) declares the linguistic unity between Valencian and Catalan varieties.[11]\n\nThe AVL, created by the Valencian parliament, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian, and its standard is based on the Norms of Castelló (Normes de Castelló). Currently, everyone who writes in Valencian uses this standard, except the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses an independent standard for Valencian.\n\nDespite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004[129] showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan. This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses for Valencian a standard independent from Catalan.[130]\n\nThis clash of opinions has sparked much controversy. For example, during the drafting of the European Constitution in 2004, the Spanish government supplied the EU with translations of the text into Basque, Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the latter two were identical.[131]\n\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nLiterary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there has been a tendency towards favoring words of Northern dialects to the detriment of others.\n\nLike other languages, Catalan has a large list of loanwords from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in Ramon Llull's work. In the 14th and 15th centuries Catalan had a far greater number of Greco-Latin loanwords than other Romance languages, as is attested for example in Roís de Corella's writings. The incorporation of learned, or \"bookish\" words from its own ancestor language, Latin, into Catalan is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Catalan speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Catalan.\n\nThe process of morphological derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages, where inflection is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctric [əˈlɛktri ] (\"electrical\") vs. electricitat [ələktri iˈtat]. Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, as in preveure (\"foresee\").\n\nThere is greater regularity in the process of word-compounding, where one can find compounded words formed much like those in English.\n\nCatalan uses the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs. The Catalan orthography is systematic and largely phonologically based. Standardization of Catalan was among the topics discussed during the First International Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC, founded in 1911) published the Normes ortogràfiques in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castelló de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called Normes de Castelló, a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra's Catalan language norms.[134]\n\nThe grammar of Catalan is similar to other Romance languages. Features include:\n• Use of definite and indefinite articles.\n• Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine), and number (singular and plural). There is no case inflexion, except in pronouns.\n• Verbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).\n• There are no modal auxiliaries.\n• Word order is freer than in English.\n\nIn gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian), the loss of the typical masculine suffix -o. Thus, the alternance of -o/-a, has been replaced by ø/-a. There are only a few exceptions, such as minso/minsa (\"scarce\"). Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, such as:\n• Loss of : / (\"flat\") vs. / (\"second\")\n\nCatalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has noi/noia (\"boy\"/\"girl\") and gall/gallina (\"cock\"/\"hen\"), whereas French has garçon/fille and coq/poule.\n\nThere is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favor of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta (\"boiling\") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.\n\nAs in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely. The most important one is the addition of -o- before certain consonant groups, a phonetic phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: el pols/els polsos (\"the pulse\"/\"the pulses\") vs. la pols/les pols (\"the dust\"/\"the dusts\").\n\nThe inflection of determinatives is complex, specially because of the high number of elisions, but is similar to the neighboring languages. Catalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, such as dels (\"of + the [plural]\"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).\n\nCentral Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favor of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian.\n\nThe morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, especially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian). Features include the gender-neutral ho and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).\n\nCatalan pronouns exhibit T–V distinction, like all other Romance languages (and most European languages, but not Modern English). This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.\n\nThis flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommandé à lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a él. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).\n\nLike all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.\n\nThe Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the synthetic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of anar (\"to go\") + infinitive.\n\nCatalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.\n\nThe grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is subject–verb–object.[142] However, word order is very flexible. Commonly, verb-subject constructions are used to achieve a semantic effect. The sentence \"The train has arrived\" could be translated as Ha arribat el tren or El tren ha arribat. Both sentences mean \"the train has arrived\", but the former puts a focus on the train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival. This subtle distinction is described as \"what you might say while waiting in the station\" versus \"what you might say on the train\".\n\nIn Spain, every person officially has two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname. The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the Catalan conjunction i (\"and\").[145]\n\nSelected text from Manuel de Pedrolo's 1970 novel Un amor fora ciutat (\"A love affair outside the city\").\n• Gramàtica Normativa Valenciana (Valencian grammar).

Thanks to these dunes the island of Formentera is a natural paradise that is unique in the entire Mediterranean.\n\nThe northern end of Formentera is home to the Ses Illetes beach and the nearby islet of S’Espalmador. These are captivating extensions of pinkish sand formed into a string of coastal dunes. These dunes are highly valuable in ecological terms, thanks to the specific plants, such as the juniper, and the specialised fauna that live there. These dunes often act as natural barriers, protecting the salt marshes.\n\nBoth Ses Illetes and S’Espalmador are part of the Parque Natural de las Salinas de Ibiza y Formentera, a natural 15.000-hectare site that protects southern Ibiza and northern Formentera.\n\nS’Espalmador is an idyllic islet close to the Ses Illetes beach, with crystal-clear water and covered in a forest of pine trees and junipers, which you can reach even on foot, as the narrow stretch of water that separates it from the rest of Formentera is quite shallow. It offers one of the best-preserved and most amazing beaches, with a thousand metres of fine sand the s’Alga beach is a visual delight for visitors. This makes it one of the most attractive places on the whole island.\n\nSes Illetes is a well-known sandy beach that is one and a half kilometres long, but in many sections only 50 metres wide. This lets you bathe in “two seas”, to the east and to the west, although both have crystalline water and only a short distance from the sand both have valuable prairies of Posidonia oceánica (seagrass) that have been declared World Heritage by the Unesco.Hostal Illes Pitiüses | Formentera Passport: Esta habitación dispone de aire acondicionado, caja fuerte, TV y balcón privado.

It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands in area, but the second-largest by population. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (Catalan: Vila d'Eivissa, or simply Vila), Santa Eulària des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is 475 metres (1,558 feet) above sea level.\n\nIbiza is well known for its nightlife and electronic dance music club scene in the summer, which attract large numbers of tourists. The island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office have worked toward promoting more family-oriented tourism.[2][3]\n\nIbiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[4] Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or \"Pityuses\".\n\nIn British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Peninsular Spanish variant ( ib-EE-thə).[5] In American English, the pronunciation is closer to the Latin American Spanish variant ( ib-EE-zə,[6] ee-BEE-sə,[7][8][9] and so forth) and the first syllable is never pronounced as a homophone of \"eye\".\n\nPhoenician colonists called the island Ibossim, likely due the abundance of aromatic plants on the island. Other speculation is (Phoenician: 𐤀𐤉𐤁𐤔𐤌, ʾYBŠM, \"Dedicated to Bes\").[11][12] It was later known to Romans as Ebusus.\n\nThe Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the Pityoûssai (Πιτυοῦσσαι, probably meaning \"Pine-Covered Islands\").[13] The Catalan name Pitiüses and the Spanish name Pitiusas retain this Greek root.\n\nIts name in Catalan is Eivissa ( pronounced [əjˈvisə]). The Spanish name is Ibiza ( pronounced [iˈβiθa] in Spain / [iˈβisa] in Latin America).\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica, possibly from an older Spanish orthography with ⟨ç⟩.[14]\n\nIn 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum) and wool.\n\nA shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Mallorca (Majorca), such as Na Guardis, and \"Na Galera\" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers,[a] to fight for Carthage.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers (Publius and Gnaeus) in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian general Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Muslims in 902. The few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of Dénia—the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community—and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of Dénia for some time (11th century).\n\nIbiza, together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca, were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon and Alcácer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.[16]\n\nThe island was conquered for the Crown of Aragon in 1235.[17] The local Muslim population was deported, as was the case with neighboring Mallorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Mallorca, Menorca and Formentera.\n\nThough primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[18]\n\nA notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of Ibiza City, which were awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world's few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the medieval wall is still visible. There are some Ibizan cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland. The oceanic plant Posidonia oceanica is also part of UNESCO's World Heritage.\n• Penjats Island is the southernmost islet of Ibiza\n\nIbiza is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres (221.07 sq mi), almost one-sixth the size of Mallorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos in the Greek Isles, or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIbiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the Pityusic Islands (Pitiusas) or \"Pine Islands\" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at 475 metres (1,558 ft).\n\nIbiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Mallorca. Ibiza comprises five of the region's 67 municipalities:\n\nAt the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an officially estimated total of 159,180 at the start of 2023,[20] and have a land area of 572.56 km2 (221.07 sq mi).\n\nThe island's self-government institution is the Ibiza Island Council (Consell Insular d'Eivissa). Prior to its split in 2007, Formentera was part of the council.[21]\n\nElections are held every four years concurrently with local elections. From 1983 to 2007, councilors were indirectly elected from the results of the election to Parliament of the Balearic Islands for the constituencies of Ibiza and Formentera (then forming a single Island council, with Ibiza sending 12 councilors and Formentera a single one). Since 2007, however, separate direct elections are held to elect the Island Council of Ibiza, which has kept 13 as the number of seats (despite sending 12 to the Balearic Parliament).\n\nIbiza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is 18.3 °C (65 °F), being warm and mild throughout the whole year. Ibiza lies at the same latitude as Atlantic City, yet it is much warmer for its location in the Mediterranean Basin. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount ranges from 400 to 450 millimetres (16 to 18 in). The average high temperature is 22.3 °C (72 °F), while the average low is 14.2 °C (58 °F). Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and fairly humid, which contributes to high dew points and muggy weather, increasing the heat index, although with very little rainfall. The few rainy days are often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is 15.8 °C (60 °F), while the average low is 7.9 °C (46 °F). In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is 30.4 °C (87 °F), while the low is 22.2 °C (72 °F). Extreme temperatures are rare for the influence of the sea. The average temperature of the sea in Ibiza is 19.7 °C (67 °F)[23] and beach weather usually lasts 7 months, from May to November. The highest temperature ever recorded on Ibiza Airport is 41 °C (106 °F) on 13 August 2022.\n\nDemographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and at the Census of 2021 had reached 154,186. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza; 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile); and the remaining 10 to 15 per cent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears – IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch.\n\nThe Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francolí was born in Ibiza,[29] as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes.[30] Notable former residents of Ibiza include: Spandau Ballet's Steve Norman, English punk musician Sid Vicious,[31] comic actor Terry-Thomas,[32] Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory,[33] American authors Cormac McCarthy and Clifford Irving.[34]\n\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and immigrants living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages, such as English, French, German and Italian, are widely spoken.[35]\n\nIbiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island's capital on the southern shore, and Sant Antoni to the west. Ibiza has garnered the reputation as the \"Party Capital of the world\".[36][37]\n\nNightlife in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s.[citation needed] During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take recreational drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented country estates in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.[38]\n\nDuring the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several venues opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife.[citation needed] Three of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Amnesia and Es Paradís.[clarification needed] These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties.[39] The club would close at 18:00 and open again at 07:00, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.[39]\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.[citation needed]\n\nIn recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music. The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.[citation needed]\n\nSince 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape.[40] Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.[41]\n\nThe season now traditionally begins at the end of April, where Opening Parties take place at Ibiza's clubs over the course of a three-week period. Opening Parties normally coincide with the culmination of the International Music Summit, a three-day conference promoting the electronic music industry, featuring speakers, masterclasses and performances, and co-hosted by Pete Tong and Jaguar. IMS has taken place on the island annually since 2007 and holds its closing party at the top of Dalt Vila.[42][43] The first clubs that host opening parties are normally Ushuaïa, Hï, Amnesia, and Pacha.[44] The first parties take place at the end of April, starting with the Hï and Ushuaïa Opening Parties, and the last parties occur around mid-October, usually being the Amnesia and Pacha Closing Parties.[45] Ibiza has recently won numerous awards globally for its world class nightlife venues.[46] The new super clubs including Hi and Ushuaïa, are two of the most notable as of 2024.[47]\n\nThe island's government is in the process of making policy changes[when?] to encourage a more family-friendly and quieter tourism scene. These include rules such as the closing of all nightclubs by 06:00 at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star.[48] The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.[49][clarification needed][needs update]\n\nThe island's tourism is not always characterized by its nightlife. Visitors can take a hot-air balloon ride, surf, visit the Cave Can Mark, or go to Cap Blanc's Aquarium.[50]\n\nSince the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Lluís Sert's abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra,[51] the half-completed and now demolished \"Idea\" nightclub in Sant Antoni,[52] and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called \"Festival Club\" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s.[53] The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andrès has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called \"Donde nada ocurre\" (Where nothing happens).[54] In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has received an increase in the number of tourists every year, with nearly 6 million people travelling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the \"clubbing calendar\"[55] which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.[56]\n\nIbiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure.[57] This has led to the imposition of a \"Sustainable Tourism Tax\" which went into effect on 1 July 2016.[58] Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium on building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal tourist beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's 572 square kilometres (221 sq mi), not much more tourism can be supported.[58]\n\nIbiza has its own airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union and the United Kingdom.\n\nThere are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Mallorca, Dénia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eulària, and Figueretes–Platja d'en Bossa.[59]\n\nSeveral public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town, every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the airport and Santa Eulària.[60] The late night bus line that stops at the various clubs is locally known as the Disco Bus.[61]\n\nA number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including: \"The Life Impossible\" by Matt Haig, \"The Canticle of Ibiza\" by Justin Kurian, \"The White Island\" by Stephen Armstrong, Joshua Then and Now by Mordecai Richler, Soma Blues by Robert Sheckley,[62] Vacation in Ibiza by Lawrence Schimel,[63] A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery by Hannah Blank,[64] They Are Ruining Ibiza by A. C. Greene,[65] and The Python Project by Victor Canning.[66] Books including Ibiza Bohemia,[67] which was published by Assouline, have explored the island itself with both photography and text, while other such as Memes Eivissencs have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.\n\nThe third track on Prefab Sprout's 1990 album Jordan: The Comeback is 'Machine Gun Ibiza'.[68] It is also mentioned in David Bowie's 1971 track 'Life on Mars?', \"See the mice in their million hordes, from Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads.\"[69]\n\nIn Monty Python's Flying Circus, the opening sketch of Episode 33 features the pilot Biggles. His secretary teasingly calls him \"Señor Biggles\", and Biggles protests, saying, \"I've never even been to Spain.\" The secretary responds, \" You went to Ibiza last year.\" Biggles counters, \"That's still not grounds for calling me señor, or Don Beeg-les for that matter.\"[70]\n\nWham's 1983 hit single \"Club Tropicana\" music video was filmed in Ibiza. It was the first time George Michael & Andrew Ridgeley would leave the UK.\n\nVengaboys' 1999 single \"We're Going to Ibiza\" reached number one on the singles chart in United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The song saw a resurgence in Austria in 2019 due to the Ibiza affair.\n\nThe island is shown as the home of notorious art forger, Elmyr de Hory, in the 1973 docudrama F for Fake by Orson Welles.\n\nThe fourth track off of The Prodigy’s sixth studio album The Day Is My Enemy is titled Ibiza. The song has fast rapping and electronic beats. The rapping is performed by the band’s frontman Keith Flint (died 2019).\n\nIn popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (alternatively known as \"In Ibiza\", or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive The Truth EP; it was later released on At Night, Alone in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on 24 July 2015. \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S.,[71] and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly \"annoyed\" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party \"typecast\".[72]Dinner Plate Eivissa, Casafina by COSTA NOVA: The Salad Plate, made from fine stoneware and crafted in Portugal, features organic shapes and a reactive glaze, making each piece unique.The reactive glaze, applied during the firing process, creates exclusive patterns and tones in each piece.

The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet, and selects its ministers. As modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, they sit as members of Parliament.\n\nThe office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons.[4] In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons. The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury (prior to 1905 also the official title of the position), Minister for the Civil Service, the minister responsible for national security,[5]: p.22 and Minister for the Union.[6] The prime minister's official residence and office, by virtue of being the First Lord of the Treasury, is 10 Downing Street in London.[7]\n\nEarly conceptions of the office of prime minister evolved as the \"Primus inter pares\" or \"first among equals\", however that does not differentiate on status and responsibility upon whoever is holding office. Historically, the prime minister has never been the first among equals at any time prior to 1868. Until now, that characterisation of the prime minister is reflective of the democratic nature of their position. The power of the prime minister depends on the support of their respective party and on the popular mandate.[8] The appointment of cabinet ministers and granting of honours are done through the prime minister's power of appointment.[9][10] The prime minister alongside the cabinet proposes new legislation and decide on key policies that fit their agenda which is then passed by an act of parliament.[11]\n\nThe power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. Prime ministerial power itself evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century.[12] During the premierships of Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher, prime ministerial power expanded substantially and their leadership in the office were described as \"presidential\" due to their personal yielding of power and tight control over the cabinet.[13][14][15] The prime minister is regarded as one of the world's most powerful political leaders in modern times.[16] As the leader of the world's sixth largest economy, the prime minister hold significant domestic and international leadership alongside being the leader of a prominent member state of NATO, the G7 and G20.[17][18]\n\n58 people (55 men and 3 women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Robert Walpole taking office on 3 April 1721. The longest-serving prime minister was also Walpole, who served over 20 years, and the shortest-serving was Liz Truss, who served seven weeks. The current prime minister is Keir Starmer, who succeeded Rishi Sunak on 5 July 2024, following the 2024 general election.[19]\n\nThe position of prime minister was not created but evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history.\n\nAfter a series of bills passed by the House of Commons, such as the Bill of Rights in 1689, the powers of the monarch were reduced, being replaced by the powers of parliament. [20]\n\nThe head of Treasury, as Lord Treasurer, was give the power in 1706 following Standing Order Number 66 to draft money bills (budgets) instead of MPs outside of government. The informal term of 'Prime Minister' was first recorded around that time, which since 1721 had mostly also been the office holder for the First Lord of the Treasury.\n\nSir Robert Walpole was the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, though his predecessors as First Lord of the Treasury also held a similar position. [21]\n\nThe role of Prime Minister grew more distinct as the head of government and often more recognisable within the public than other members of the cabinet, which demonstrates the increasing power of the Prime Minister in modern times than that originally created. [22]\n\nThe prime minister is the head of the United Kingdom government.[23] As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower chamber of Parliament). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation.[24] Walter Bagehot described the office of prime minister as the \"keystone of the Cabinet arch\" that maintained while the prime minister can hold significant power over the executive, it is often exercised collectively through the Cabinet (Government).\n\nMinisterial responsibility is also an aspect of a prime minister's executive authority. The prime minister leads the cabinet which makes the holder of that office bear responsibility for the collective conduct of the government. Professor Rodney Brazier points out that the since the prime minister wields significant sway over policy, that power must be subjected to the conclusion and input of Cabinet ministers. This prevents the office of prime minister from becoming more dominant and also ensures that executive power is authorised with broader support from and within the government. The prime minister must constantly maintain the confidence of the House of Commons because, as Bagehot notes, the power of the prime minister derives from their ability to command a majority in the House in order to pass legislation and continue the functions of government. If a prime minister loses the confidence of the House, which occurs in a vote of no confidence, they are often expected to resign from office or request the monarch dissolve parliament to call a general election.\n\nThe prime minister acts as the principal advisor to the monarch, who is the head of state, a capacity that has evolved gradually during the history of the office. Bagehot says that despite the monarch holding certain theoretical executive powers, in practice, these powers are often executed upon the advice and recommendation of the prime minister and the cabinet. This is considered a major principle of the \"unity of powers\" that exists within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch \"reigns but does not rule\". According to Brazier, the prime minister advises the monarch on matters such as the dissolution of parliament and appointments to the House of Lords, but these decisions are often made with the consent of parliament.\n\nThe prime minister leads the executive in directing government policy and maintaining coordination between government departments which is dependent upon the cooperation and consent of ministers. Foreign policy and national security are areas in which the prime minister has traditionally enjoyed more authority under what are known as prerogative powers. Vernon Bogdanor argues that the abilities to declare war, negotiate treaties and deploy the armed forces have historically been part of the monarch's royal authority but have slowly evolved into a function of the office of prime minister. Despite this, the exercise of the prime minister's prerogative powers in these matters is under the oversight of parliament. It is often by convention that a prime minister must seek the approval of parliament before committing the nation to military action. In addition to this, the prime minister also exerts informal influence over public policy. Brazier notes this is due to the prime minister often being the leader of the largest party in government, therefore having a direct impact in initiating policy both in government and during election campaigns.\n\nIn the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \"face\" and \"voice\" of His Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.[32]\n\nBagehot identifies the prime minister as the leader of the \"efficient\" part of government that functions within the government to steer legislation through both Houses of Parliament. Although the prime minister does not possess the power to introduce legislation directly, their control of the cabinet and their role as leader of the largest political party in the House of Commons enables them substantial influence over any legislative agenda. Bagehot points out that this power is based on the prime minister's ability to operate the \"machinery of government\" that allows them to guide legislation that align with their party's political and ideological priorities. Brazier argues that the legislative power of the prime minister has greatly expanded following the post-war period and that as a result, the prime minister now directly authorises supervision over government bills and has a consequential role in the introduction of legislation.\n\nThe prime minister is able to wield considerable power in the passing of legislation through their ability to manage party discipline and cohesion in voting patterns. Bogdanor states that this largely depends upon the prime minister being the leader of the largest party in the Commons, which can pass legislation without any or little resistance if they can command the confidence of the House. This aspect of prime ministerial power is informal and often carried out by the office of Whips, who makes sure that MPs remain loyal and vote on the government line. The political scientist Anthony King said that the prime minister's influence over legislation is further solidified through their ability to shape policy before it reaches parliament. King further argued that the shaping of legislation, on many occasions, involves the collaborative efforts of cabinet ministers and civil servants, but the prime minister's approval is needed in order to initiate the legislative agenda. King's analysis of contemporary politcs showed that some prime ministers often bypass or overrule the cabinet on traditional discussion and to push through their preferred agendas with notable cases such as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.\n\nThe prime minister's influence in the Houses of Parliament is derived from longstanding conventions and statutes that have gradually evolved through the centuries. The office of prime minister itself is not explicitly mentioned in parliamentary law but is developed by constitutional conventions and therefore it is defined by precedent and tradition. Bogdanor notes that the prime minister's power in parliament is exhibited by their control of the executive (the Cabinet) and their ability to influence the legislative agenda. The ability of the prime minister to influence legislation, according to academic Philip Norton, is often through party discipline and having a reliable majority of MPs who vote in support of the government's priorities.\n\nAnother essential part of the parliamentary powers possessed by the prime minister is determining the composition of the Cabinet. According to Professor Robert Hazell, the prime minister not only chooses cabinet members but also dictates the collective decision-making process of members as well. The prime minister most often would chair cabinet meetings and may determine their frequency, thereby controlling the agenda for policy and steering decisions in their preferred direction. Additionally, the prime minister can exercise considerable control over parliamentary time. Authors Alexander Horne and Gavin Drewry state that the prime minister uses this power through the Leader of the House of Commons, by which they are able to allocate time for government bills and often ensuring access to this time over private members' bills.\n\nThe prime minister's parliamentary powers also extend to foreign relations. Contemporary historian Anthony Seldon says that the prime minister acts as the main representative of the government in the international sphere, including in parliament, where treaties are ratified and international commitments are debated.[full citation needed]\n\nThe most significant powers given to the prime minister are \"prerogative powers\". These are a set of constitutional privileges deriving from monarchial authority that have gradually evolved into tools of executive power managed by the prime minister and the government. Bagehot famously called the British system as one where \"the executive power is now yielded by the prime minister\" rather than the monarch, a shift from personal to political power. Prerogative powers allow the prime minister to act without the immediate or direct consent of parliament especially in circumstances such as declaring war, deployment of troops and the granting of honours.\n\nBrazier argues that prerogative powers allow the prime minister to act within the \"authority of the crown\" in situations where neither convention nor statutory law applies. As noted by both Bagehot and Brazier, areas in which the prime minister authorises their given prerogative powers are matters of foreign affairs. In recent occasions, the 2003 invasion of Iraq saw Prime Minister Tony Blair deploying British troops to Saudi Arabia without the immediate consent or approval of parliament.[43] Brazier says the rise of parliamentary and public scrutiny has led to calls for reform and checks on the use of prerogative powers.[45][46] The only prime minister who did not seek parliamentary or legal consent for military action was Anthony Eden during the Suez Crisis in 1956.[47][48]\n\nProfessors Mark Elliot and Robert Thomas argue that prerogative powers present a constitutional anomaly in the 21st century. Both contend that such powers lack direct democratic legitimacy due to not being regulated by parliamentary statutes and raise concerns over accountability. Elliot and Thomas have pointed out that judicial intervention in cases such as Miller I and Miller II, where the Supreme Court exercised scrutiny over the use of prerogative powers by the government to prorogue parliament during the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, was successful in keeping check over the authority of both the prime minister and the government. The evolving usage of prerogative powers also has signalled tension between tradition and accountability. Authors Paul Craig and Adam Tomkins state that the absence of a written constitution gives a prime minister greater leeway in employing their given prerogative powers without limits that in turn would create uncertainty although the use of such powers by the prime minister is often constrained by political convention than by law.\n\nThe British system of government is based on an uncodified constitution, meaning that it is not set out in any single document.[51] The British constitution consists of many documents, and most importantly for the evolution of the office of the prime minister, it is based on customs known as constitutional conventions that became accepted practice. In 1928, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs:\n\nThe relationships between the prime minister and the sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet are defined largely by these unwritten conventions of the constitution. Many of the prime minister's executive and legislative powers are actually royal prerogatives which are still formally vested in the sovereign, who remains the head of state.[53] Despite its growing dominance in the constitutional hierarchy, the premiership was given little formal recognition until the 20th century; the legal fiction was maintained that the sovereign still governed directly. The position was first mentioned in statute only in 1917, in the schedule of the Chequers Estate Act. Increasingly during the 20th century, the office and role of prime minister featured in statute law and official documents; however, the prime minister's powers and relationships with other institutions still largely continue to derive from ancient royal prerogatives and historic and modern constitutional conventions. Prime ministers continue to hold the position of First Lord of the Treasury and, since November 1968, that of Minister for the Civil Service, the latter giving them authority over the civil service.\n\nUnder this arrangement, Britain might appear to have two executives: the prime minister and the sovereign. The concept of \"the Crown\" resolves this paradox.[54] The Crown symbolises the state's authority to govern: to make laws and execute them, impose taxes and collect them, declare war and make peace. Before the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688, the sovereign exclusively wielded the powers of the Crown; afterwards, Parliament gradually forced monarchs to assume a neutral political position. Parliament has effectively dispersed the powers of the Crown, entrusting its authority to responsible ministers (the prime minister and Cabinet), accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament, in particular the elected House of Commons.\n\nAlthough many of the sovereign's prerogative powers are still legally intact,[n 1] constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day-to-day governance, with ministers exercising the royal prerogatives, leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise and to warn.[55][56]\n\nIn modern times, much of the process involving prime ministerial appointments is informally governed by constitutional conventions and with the rules and processes described by authoritative sources such as The Cabinet Manual.[57]\n\nThe prime minister is appointed by the monarch, through the exercise of the royal prerogative.[58] In the past, the monarch has used personal choice to dismiss or appoint a prime minister (the last time being in 1834), but it is now the convention that the monarch should not be drawn into party politics.[5]: 3 Bogdanor states that throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the monarch often appointed the prime minister based on their personal preference, regardless of whether they have great or little public support.\n\nIf a prime minister (incumbent or otherwise) leads their party to victory in a general election and gains an overall majority in the House of Commons they will be invited by the monarch to form a new government.[60] Following the invitation, the prime minister will be driven to Buckingham Palace to meet the monarch.[61][62][63] The meeting between the monarch and the incoming prime minister is a moment for the latter to pledge their loyalty to the monarch and seek permission to form a new government. The prime minister is expected to bow before the monarch in a ceremony known as \"kissing hands\". Following this, the prime minister is officially appointed the head of His Majesty's government.[64][65][66]\n\nThe prime minister \"...holds that position by virtue of his or her ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, which in turn commands the confidence of the electorate, as expressed through a general election.\"[5]: 3.1 By convention, the prime minister is also an MP and is normally the leader of the political party that commands a majority in the House of Commons.[5]: 3.1 [n 2]\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office helps the prime minister to 'establish and deliver the government's overall strategy and policy priorities, and to communicate the government's policies to Parliament, the public and international audiences'.[67] The Prime Minister's Office is formally part of the Cabinet Office, but the boundary between its work and that of the wider Cabinet Office can be unclear;[68] the wider Cabinet Office might carry out very similar work. Peter Hennessy has claimed that this overall arrangement means there is in fact effectively a Prime Minister's Department, though it is not called this.[69]\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office was officially created in 1916 by David Lloyd George during the World War I, which marked the first formal recognition of the office of prime minister and established it as an independent institution from other entities within government, with staff to support the coordination of government policy. This development came as a response to the demands of wartime governance, as Lloyd George's leadership needed a more centred and efficient executive function.\n\nPrime Minister's Questions is a constitutional convention, currently held as a single session every Wednesday at noon when the House of Commons is sitting, in which the prime minister answers questions from members of Parliament (MPs). The leader of the opposition usually asks the prime minister six questions, and the leader of the third-largest parliamentary party can ask two questions. It is an occasion when the prime minister appears regularly on live television and radio.\n\nBefore the 1880s, oral questions were mainly directed towards cabinet ministers and therefore such questions were regarded as the same even when addressed to the Prime Minister. The session in its modern form was first introduced on Tuesday 24 October in 1961 when the then Prime Minister Harold Macmillan answered questions for between 15 minutes from 3.15pm to 3.30pm as an experiment. Since 1997 PMQs were held every Wednesdays at 3pm until 3.30pm.[71] In 1989, the first PMQs were broadcast and in 1990 were broadcast live to the public as a step towards transparency and accountability.[72]\n\nThe timing of PMQs has often changed depending on the varied schedules of prime ministers.[73][74] In 1881, questions addressed to the prime minister were placed at the end of question time so that the then 72-year old Prime Minister William Gladstone could arrive late. In 1904, questions were answered only when they reached No 51 and in 1940 they were expanded to No 45. The procedure was in practice until 1953 when PMQs were restricted to Tuesdays and Thursdays only to assist Winston Churchill who was 78-years old.[75]\n\nThe prime minister also appears before the Liaison Committee to answer questions about public policy.[76]\n\nThe personal protection of the prime minister[77] and former prime ministers[78] is the responsibility of Protection Command within the Metropolitan Police Service. When the prime minister resides in 10 Downing Street, they are constantly surrounded by armed police units with \"airport-style\" security checkpoints, large metal gates, street patrols and heavy vetting for staff and non-ministerial individuals. Such installations were introduced due to fears of IRA bomb threats and attacks which were persistent during The Troubles. When travelling, the prime minister will be accompanied by a select group of police officers joined by a wider team of security personnel. On the road, the prime ministerial entourage will be followed by police outriders on motorbikes to clear a path in the traffic and to stop them from being a sitting target.[79] The fleet of Prime Ministerial Cars provides the prime minister with a number of security features as well as transport. The vehicles are driven by officers from this unit.[80] These vehicles are often custom made and always British manufactured with in-built gun ports, an independent oxygen supply and the ability to release tear gas to subdue angry crowds.[81] Air transport for the prime minister is provided by a variety of military and civilian operators.\n\nOne of the roles of the prime minister is to represent the UK at home and abroad,[82] for example at the annual G7 Summit. The prime minister makes many international trips. According to Gus O'Donnell, the number of overseas visits for the prime minister has gone up.[83]\n\nPrime ministers have had various deputies, sometimes as an official deputy prime minister, first secretary of state or de facto deputy. Some prime ministers have not chosen a deputy at all, preferring ad hoc arrangements.[84]\n\nHistorically, the position of deputy prime minister has been created out of political necessity rather than being established by statutory law or convention with the title not being defined in the constitution. The position was first created (unofficially) for Clement Attlee in Prime Minister Winston Churchill's ministry during World War II, in order to manage administrative duties, domestic affairs and welfare, while Churchill focused on military strategy. In recent times, after the 2010 general election resulted in a hung parliament, the leaders of the Conservative and the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, formed a coalition government in which Clegg served as deputy prime minister. In that capacity, Clegg chaired cabinet meetings, key committees and led negotiations on major reforms. As such, the office saw an unusual level of formalisation and recognition during Clegg's tenure.\n\nNobody has the right of automatic succession to the prime ministership.[88] It is generally considered that in the event of the death of the prime minister, it would be appropriate to appoint an interim prime minister, though there is some debate as to how to decide who this should be.[89]\n\nAccording to Rodney Brazier, there are no procedures within government to cope with the sudden death of the prime minister.[90] There is also no such title as acting prime minister of the United Kingdom.[91] Despite refusing \"...to discuss a hypothetical situation\" with BBC News in 2011,[92] the Cabinet Office said the following in 2006:[93]\n\nAdditionally, when the prime minister is travelling, it is standard practice for a senior duty minister to be appointed who can attend to urgent business and meetings if required, though the prime minister remains in charge and updated throughout.[94]\n\nOn 6 April 2020, when Boris Johnson was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit of St Thomas' Hospital, when suffering from COVID-19, he asked Dominic Raab \"to deputise for him where necessary\".[95]\n\nA prime minister ends their tenure by offering their resignation to the British monarch.[96] This can happen after their party has suffered a general election defeat, so that they no longer command the confidence of the House of Commons. It can also happen mid-term, if they are forced to resign for political reasons,[97] or for other reasons such as ill-health.[98] If the prime minister resigns mid-term, and their party has a majority in the Commons, the party selects a new leader according to its rules, and this new leader is invited by the monarch to become the new prime minister. The outgoing prime minister is likely to remain in post until the new leader has been chosen by the party. After resigning, the outgoing prime minister remains a Member of Parliament. An outgoing prime minister can ask the monarch to bestow honours on any number of people of their choosing, known as the Prime Minister's Resignation Honours. No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election.[99] Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812.\n\nOn taking office a new prime minister usually makes a public statement to announce to the country that they have been appointed by the reigning monarch (called \"kissing hands\"). This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:\n\nMinisterial listings are printed in the official records of parliament known as \"Hansard\", and 1885 was the first known instance of official use of the title of Prime Minister. The minutes of the first meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1902 saw the first internal reference to the title as well. The 1904 edition of the Imperial Calendar referred to the then Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour, as 'Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury'; in the previous edition he was merely 'First Lord of the Treasury and Lord Privy Seal'.[101]\n\nThroughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures.[n 3] The prime minister was officially granted a place in the order of precedence in December 1905, and the first statutory reference to the Prime Minister was present in the Chequers Estate Act 1917, which specified Chequers as a prime-ministerial residence. Public recognition of the existence of a 'Prime Minister's Office' in the Civil Service Yearbook came as recently as the 1977 edition.[101]\n\nThe prime minister is customarily a member of the Privy Council and thus entitled to the appellation \"The Right Honourable\". Membership of the council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed prime minister. Most potential candidates have already attained this status. The only case when a non-privy counsellor was the natural appointment was Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. The issue was resolved by appointing him to the Council immediately prior to his appointment as prime minister.\n\nAccording to the now-defunct Department for Constitutional Affairs, the prime minister is made a privy counsellor as a result of taking office and should be addressed by the official title prefixed by \"The Right Honourable\" and not by a personal name.[citation needed] Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions, it is rarely used by the media. As \"prime minister\" is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as \"the prime minister\", although the title \"Prime Minister\" (e.g. \"Prime Minister Keir Starmer\") has become commonplace within current political reporting.[102][103][104] Within the UK, the expression \"Prime Minister Starmer\" is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2010, the prime minister received £14,500 in addition to a salary of £65,737 as a member of parliament.[105] Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister. During the premiership of Gordon Brown, the prime minister received an salary of £193,885 on 1 April 2009 which was higher than the salary of £166,786 as of 2024. The reasons for such reductions are Brown's cuts to voluntary pay at around £150,000 during pre-election in the May 2010 election, and when David Cameron became prime minister the cuts were extended to 5%, amounting at around £142,500. Subsequent prime ministers have kept the restraint on ministerial pay and have not taken any further pay outside of what they are entitled.[106] According to journalist Simon Kelner, the salary of the prime minister must be increased and that further expansion of a salary or hospitality received by a prime minister is disavowed under the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883 which only criminalised voter bribery and introduced standards for election expenses, and \"created a more level playing field for parliamentary candidates\". Kelner said that it is a inadequate way of holding a prime minister into account. This was in respone to the 2024 Labour Party freebies controversy, in which the current prime minister, Keir Starmer, having reportedly failed to disclose the amount of gifts and \"freebies\" received by him, members of his family and cabinet.[107][108][109]\n\n10 Downing Street, in London, has been the official place of residence of the prime minister since 1732; they are entitled to use its staff and facilities, including extensive offices. The building was originally given by King George I to Robert Walpole, widely regarded as the nation's first prime minister, as a personal gift. However, Walpole insisted that he would accept it in his capacity as first lord of the Treasury and requested that his subsequent successors be entitled to reside in and use the property as they wish.[110] The complex incorporates the flats of No.11 and No.12 Downing Street, which have been reconstructed through to connect them to No.10. Altogether, the three buildings contain over 100 rooms.[111]\n\nChequers, a country house in Buckinghamshire, gifted to the government in 1917, may be used as a country retreat for the prime minister. The estate was previously owned by the Conservative minister and First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Arthur Lee, before being donated to the British government under the Chequers Estate Act 1917. It was to give the incumbent prime minister the time to \"spend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern hills and woods\" and on the condition that incumbent should not own any residential country estate of their own.[112][113]\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, many prime ministers were members of the British nobility and therefore held the office whilst serving in the House of Lords. Through lineage and inheritance, these prime ministers acquired large estates, though they still owned properties in London for political affairs and many used country houses as a retreat. Until the mid-20th Century, parliamentary sessions did not begin until the New Year after ending in August, which would give the prime minister long periods in respite.[114]\n\nUpon retirement, it is customary for the sovereign to grant a prime minister some honour or dignity. The honour bestowed is commonly, but not invariably, membership of the UK's most senior order of chivalry, the Order of the Garter. The practice of creating a retired prime minister a Knight Companion of the Garter (KG) has been fairly prevalent since the mid-nineteenth century. Upon the retirement of a prime minister who is Scottish, it is likely that the primarily Scottish honour of Knight of the Thistle (KT) will be used instead of the Order of the Garter, which is generally regarded as an English honour.[n 4]\n\nHistorically it has also been common to grant prime ministers a peerage upon retirement from the Commons, elevating the individual to the Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an earldom.[n 5] The last such creation was for Harold Macmillan, who resigned in 1963. Unusually, he became Earl of Stockton only in 1984, over twenty years after leaving office.\n\nMacmillan's successors Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, David Cameron, and Theresa May all accepted life peerages (although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as Earl of Home and Cameron received a peerage after reentering Government as Foreign Secretary, not for services as a former Prime Minister). Edward Heath did not accept a peerage of any kind; neither have any of the prime ministers who have retired since 1990 other than Cameron (having done so to re-join the Cabinet, rather than as an honour per se) and May. Edward Heath (in 1992), John Major (in 2005) and Tony Blair (in 2022) were appointed as Knights Companion of the Garter. Major (in 1998) and Gordon Brown (in 2024) were appointed members of the Order of the Companions of Honour, although Blair had previously disclosed that he did not want honours bestowed on himself or future prime ministers.\n\nThe most recent former prime minister to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979–1990) on 8 April 2013. Her death meant that for the first time since 1955 (the year in which the Earldom of Attlee was created, subsequent to the death of Earl Baldwin in 1947) the membership of the House of Lords included no former prime minister, a situation which remained the case until David Cameron was appointed to the House in November 2023.\n\nThere are currently no established roles or job positions for former prime ministers following their resignations or after leaving office unexpectedly. It depends on their personal choice and reasons surrounding the need to take on such positions. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many former prime ministers, who were wealthy members of the nobility, would often simply retire to their country estates. The first prime minister, Robert Walpole, accumulated large personal wealth while serving in office and from previous investments made in the 1710s. Prime Ministers Lord Bute and Lord Rosebery were among the wealthiest men in the country during their retirements and are often touted as some of the wealthiest to serve as in office. However some prime ministers, such as William Pitt the Elder and his son William Pitt the Younger, amassed large public debts that were later paid off by parliament. In 1937, an official pension for former prime ministers was given at the sum of £2000 per annum.[117]\n\nIn their retirements, a majority of former prime ministers have written memoirs and autobiographies. Some prime ministers have also written non-political books as well, including Winston Churchill's histories of World War II and of the English language,[118][119] Edward Heath's books on his wider interests in sailing, music and travel, Major's history of cricket[120][121] and Arthur Balfour's philosophical writings.[122] Some prime ministers such as William Gladstone mainly wrote tracts and tomes on theology and religion[123] and Benjamin Disraeli wrote many best-selling novels in addition to memoirs and history.[124][117][125]\n\nIn the 21st century, many former prime ministers have set up their own foundations and charities to be used as a platform to continue involvement in political and public issues after they leave office.[117] In 1991, Margaret Thatcher became the first prime minister to set up her own foundation to try to secure her legacy and propagate her ideology known as Thatcherism, but it closed down in 2005.[126] Tony Blair has set up a sports foundation, an inter-faith foundation and the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in 2016.[127] In his post-premiership, Blair is also the first prime minister to take on a major international role, as an official envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East.[128] Gordon Brown was actively involved in politics long after he left office, most notably during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in which he campaigned for the no vote that advocated Scotland to remain in the union.[129][130]\n\nHowever, some former prime ministers have returned to serve in the governments of their successors, and a few have had 'retreads' that saw them serve short tenures due to their successors unexpectedly resigning or passing away. Notable cases include the Duke of Wellington who, after serving two brief terms in office, was able to command significant influence as a senior member of the Tory party and returned to serve in two governments of his successor, Sir Robert Peel, as Foreign Secretary and Minister without portfolio. He later retired to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Army from 1842 until his death in 1852.[117] Arthur Balfour served as prime minister for three years of his term after he was defeated in the 1906 general election and later went on to serve as the Foreign Secretary for eleven years in the imperial war cabinet during and after World War I under three prime ministers. After Neville Chamberlain resigned as prime minister in May 1940, he returned to serve under Winston Churchill in his subsequent war cabinet. Alec Douglas-Home, who resigned after losing the 1964 general election, later came to serve in the cabinet of Edward Heath in 1970.[131]\n\nAll former prime ministers are entitled to claim for salary or office expenses incurred in fulfilling public duties in that role. The allowance may not be used to pay for private or parliamentary duties. It is administered by the Cabinet Office Finance Team.\n\nThe maximum amount which may be claimed per year is £115,000, plus 10% towards any staff pension costs. This limit is reviewed annually, and at the start of each Parliament, by the current prime minister. The maximum level may be adjusted downwards if the former prime minister receives any public funds for fulfilling other public appointments.[132] Downing Street confirmed in November 2023 that former prime minister David Cameron would not claim from the PDCA while he acted as Foreign Secretary.[133]\n\nLists of prime ministers by different criteria\n\nAll lists: Category:Lists of prime ministers of the United Kingdom\n\nMore related pages: Category:Prime ministers of the United Kingdom\n• None Bogdanor, Vernon (1997).

A prime minister is not the head of state, but rather the head of government, serving as the chief of the executive under either a monarch or a president in a republican form of government.\n\nIn parliamentary systems of government (be they constitutional monarchies or parliamentary republics), the Prime Minister (or occasionally a similar post with a different title, such as the Chancellor of Germany) is the most powerful politician and the functional leader of the state, by virtue of commanding the confidence of the legislature. The head of state is typically a ceremonial officer, though they may exercise reserve powers to check the Prime Minister in unusual situations.\n\nUnder some presidential systems, such as South Korea and Peru, the prime minister is the leader or the most senior member of the cabinet, but not the head of government. As such, in South Korea, the prime minister is equivalent to that of a vice president which is the second in-command and assumes the presidency in the absence of the president.\n\nIn many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems, a prime minister is the official appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state.\n\nToday, the prime minister is often, but not always, a member of the legislature or its lower house, and is expected with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the legislature. In some monarchies the monarch may also exercise executive powers (known as the royal prerogative) without the approval of parliament.\n\nAs well as being head of government, being prime minister may require holding other roles or posts—the prime minister of the United Kingdom, for example, is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service.[note 1] In some cases, prime ministers may choose to hold additional ministerial posts (e.g. when the portfolio is critical to that government's mandate): during the Second World War, Winston Churchill was also Minister of Defence (although there was then no Ministry of Defence). Another example is the Thirty-fourth government of Israel (2015–2019) , when Benjamin Netanyahu at one point served as the prime minister and minister of Communications, Foreign Affairs, Regional Cooperation, Economy, Defense and Interior.\n\nThe term \"prime minister\" was used as (vazîr-i aʾzam) or the Grand Vizier in 8th century by the Abbasid caliphate.[1][2][3]\n\nin 17th century sources referring to Cardinal Richelieu,[4] after he was named premier ministre to head the French royal council in 1624. The title was used alongside the principal ministre d'État (\"chief minister of the state\") more as a job description. After 1661, Louis XIV and his descendants refused to allow one of their Ministers to be more important than the others, so the term was no longer in use.[5]\n\nIn the 18th century in the United Kingdom, members of parliament disparagingly used the title in reference to Sir Robert Walpole (whose official title was First Lord of the Treasury). During the whole of the 18th century, Britain was involved in a prolonged conflict with France, periodically bursting into all-out war, and Britons took outspoken pride in their \"Liberty\" as contrasted to the \"Tyranny\" of French Absolute Monarchy; therefore, being implicitly compared with Richelieu was no compliment to Walpole. Over time, however, the title became honorific[where?] and remains so in the 21st century.[6]\n\nThe position of a head of government separate from the head of state, or as the most important government administrator or minister after the monarch in rank developed in multiple countries separate from each other. The names given could be \"prime minister\", although other terms were also used such as \"chief minister\", \"grand chancellor\", \"chancellor\", \"grand vizier\", \"counselor\", and others.\n\nThe literal title itself can be traced back to the Abbasid caliphate and the Ottoman Empire . They both had an official title of Grand Vizier simply the Head of the Government which is called Prime Minister nowadays. Grand Vizier was the most powerful person after sultan but sometimes the Grand Vizier of Ottoman Empire was more powerful than sultan himself.[7][8][9] The position of Chancellor is the same or comparable in some countries as a prime minister, even if the label is different. The term goes back to ancient Roman times as head of the chancellery. This title as head of government or the administration existed in ancient China as Grand Chancellor (Chinese: 宰相; pinyin: Zǎixiàng), sometimes translated as \"prime minister\", existed since 685 BCE and ancient Japan Chancellor of the Realm (太政大臣 Daijō-daijin) since the 7th century CE. In the Holy Roman Empire the position of Archchancellor was the highest dignitary and traces to 860 CE, out of which later derived the positions of head of government such as the modern Chancellor of Germany, who is head of the federal government and an executive prime minister.\n\nThe power of these ministers depended entirely on the personal favour of the monarch. Although managing the parliament was among the necessary skills of holding high office, they did not depend on a parliamentary majority for their power. Although there was a cabinet, it was appointed entirely by the monarch, and the monarch usually presided over its meetings.\n\nThe monarch could dismiss the minister at any time, or worse: Cromwell was executed and Clarendon driven into exile when they lost favour. Kings sometimes divided power equally between two or more ministers to prevent one minister from becoming too powerful. Late in Anne's reign, for example, the Tory ministers Harley and Viscount Bolingbroke shared power.\n\nIn the mid 17th century, after the English Civil War (1642–1651), Parliament strengthened its position relative to the monarch then gained more power through the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689.[10] The monarch could no longer establish any law or impose any tax without its permission and thus the House of Commons became a part of the government. It is at this point that a modern style of prime minister begins to emerge.[11][12]\n\nA tipping point in the evolution of the prime ministership came with the death of Anne in 1714 and the accession of George I to the throne. George spoke no English, spent much of his time at his home in Hanover, and had neither knowledge of, nor interest in, the details of British government. In these circumstances it was inevitable that the king's first minister would become the de facto head of the government.\n\nFrom 1721, this was the Whig politician Robert Walpole, who held office for twenty-one years. Walpole chaired cabinet meetings, appointed all the other ministers, dispensed the royal patronage and packed the House of Commons with his supporters. Under Walpole, the doctrine of cabinet solidarity developed. Walpole required that no minister other than himself have private dealings with the king, and also that when the cabinet had agreed on a policy, all ministers must defend it in public, or resign. As a later prime minister, Lord Melbourne, said, \"It matters not what we say, gentlemen, so long as we all say the same thing.\"\n\nWalpole always denied that he was \"prime minister\", and throughout the 18th century parliamentarians and legal scholars continued to deny that any such position was known to the Constitution. George II and George III made strenuous efforts to reclaim the personal power of the monarch, but the increasing complexity and expense of government meant that a minister who could command the loyalty of the Commons was increasingly necessary. The long tenure of the wartime prime minister William Pitt the Younger (1783–1801), combined with the mental illness of George III, consolidated the power of the post. The title \"prime minister\" was first referred to on government documents during the administration of Benjamin Disraeli but did not appear in the formal British Order of precedence until 1905.\n\nThe prestige of British institutions in the 19th century and the growth of the British Empire saw the British model of cabinet government, headed by a prime minister, widely copied, both in other European countries and in British colonial territories as they developed self-government.[13][14][15] In some places alternative titles such as \"premier\", \"chief minister\", \"first minister of state\", \"president of the council\" or \"chancellor\" were adopted, but the essentials of the office were the same.\n\nIn the late 20th century,[16][17] many of the world's countries had prime ministers or equivalent ministers, holding office under either constitutional monarchies or ceremonial presidents. The main exceptions to this system include Switzerland and the United States, as well as the presidential republics in Latin America, such as Chile and Mexico, modelled on the U.S. system in which the president directly exercises executive authority.\n\nBahrain's former prime minister, Sheikh Khalifah bin Sulman Al Khalifah, occupied the post for about 50 years, from 1970 to November 2020, making him the longest serving non-elected prime minister.\n\nThe post of prime minister may be encountered both in constitutional monarchies (such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Malaysia, Morocco, Spain,[note 2] Sweden, Thailand, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) and in parliamentary republics, in which the head of state is an elected official (such as Bangladesh, Finland, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia (1945–66), Ireland, Nigeria (1960–66), Pakistan, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Turkey (1923–2018) and Italy). See also \"First Minister\", \"Premier\", \"Chief Minister\", \"Chancellor\", \"Taoiseach\", \"Minister of State (Statsminister)\", \"President of the Government\", \"President of the Council of Ministers\" and \"Secretary of State\": alternative titles usually equivalent in meaning to, or translated as, \"prime minister\". Both Indonesia and Nigeria lost their positions as prime ministers in 1966. Brazil, Iran, the Philippines and Turkey also lost their positions as prime ministers. Chile, Mexico, Switzerland and the United States never had positions as prime ministers.\n\nThis contrasts with the presidential system, in which the president (or equivalent) is both the head of state and the head of the government. In some presidential and all semi-presidential systems, such as those of Algeria, Argentina, China, France, Poland, Russia, South Korea or Ukraine, the prime minister is an official generally appointed by the president but usually approved by the legislature and responsible for carrying out the directives of the president and managing the civil service. The premier of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is also appointed by the president but does not require any approval by the legislature.[citation needed]\n\nAppointment of the prime minister of France does not require any approval by the parliament either, but the parliament may force the resignation of the government. In these systems, it is possible for the president and the prime minister to be from different political parties if the legislature is controlled by a party different from that of the president. When it arises, such a state of affairs is usually referred to as (political) cohabitation.[citation needed]\n\nIn parliamentary systems a prime minister may enter into office by several means.\n• The head of state appoints a prime minister, of their personal choice: Example: France, where the president has the power to appoint the prime minister of their choice, though the National Assembly can force a government to resign, they cannot nominate or appoint a new candidate.\n• The head of state appoints a prime minister who has a set timescale within which they must gain a vote of confidence: Example: Italy, Romania, Thailand\n• The head of state appoints a formateur from among the members of Parliament, who then has a set timescale within which they must form a cabinet, and receive the confidence of Parliament after presenting the Cabinet Composition and Legislative Program to Parliament, and the formateur becomes prime minister once approved by parliament: Example: Israel\n• The head of state appoints the leader of the political party with the majority of the seats in the parliament as prime minister. If no party has a majority, then the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an exploratory mandate to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days. If this is not possible, then the leader of the party with the second highest seat number is given the exploratory mandate. If this fails, then the leader of the third largest party is given it and so on: Example: Greece, see Prime Minister of Greece\n• The head of state nominates a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment as prime minister: Example: Spain, where the King sends a nomination to parliament for approval. Also Germany where under the German Basic Law (constitution) the Bundestag votes on a candidate nominated by the federal president. In the Philippines under the 1973 Constitution as amended after martial law, the prime minister was elected by the Batasang Pambansâ (Legislature) upon nomination by the president. In these cases, parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state (or, in the case of the Philippines, outright elect that candidate).\n• Parliament nominates a candidate who the head of state is then constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister: Example: Ireland, where the president appoints the Taoiseach on the nomination of Dáil Éireann. Also Japan.\n• Election by the legislature: Example: Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Also the Philippines under the unamended 1973 Constitution, where the prime minister was supposed to be elected by the Batasang Pambansâ; these provisions were never used because the Philippines was under martial law at the time.\n• Direct election by popular vote: Example: Israel, 1996–2001, where the prime minister was elected in a general election, with no regard to political affiliation.\n• Nomination by a state office holder other than the head of state or his or her representative: Example: Under the modern Swedish Instrument of Government, the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the speaker of the parliament and the parliament itself. The speaker nominates a candidate, who is then elected to prime minister (statsminister) by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no (i.e. the candidate can be elected to the post even if more MP:s vote no than yes).\n\nIn older, convention-based parliamentary systems, prime ministers are not appointed for a specific term in office and in effect may remain in power through a number of elections and parliaments. For example, Margaret Thatcher was only ever appointed prime minister on one occasion, in 1979. She remained continuously in power until 1990, though she used the assembly of each House of Commons after a general election to reshuffle her cabinet.\n\nNewer parliamentary systems that operate based on a codified constitution, however, do have a term of office of the prime minister linked to the period in office of the parliament. Hence, for example, Latvian prime minister Krišjānis Kariņš, who was first appointed in 2018, had to be reappointed as head of a new government following the 2022 Latvian parliamentary election.\n\nThe position of prime minister is usually chosen from the political party that commands – whether by itself or as the largest member of a coalition – the majority of seats in the lower house of parliament, though this is not a requirement either; for example, following the 2018 Latvian parliamentary election, after two failed attempts by larger parties to form a coalition headed by them, the leader of the smallest party in parliament – Krišjānis Kariņš – was eventually appointed as a compromise candidate. Italy has seen several emergency technocratic governments, such as Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's and Mario Draghi's governments, where the prime minister was a non-partisan expert backed by the confidence and supply of a broad cross-section of the parliament.\n\nIn parliamentary systems, governments are generally required to have the confidence of the lower house of parliament (though a small minority of parliaments, by giving a right to block supply to upper houses, in effect make the cabinet responsible to both houses, though in reality upper houses, even when they have the power, rarely exercise it). Where they lose a vote of confidence, have a motion of no confidence passed against them, or where they lose supply, most constitutional systems require either:\n\nThe latter in effect allows the government to appeal the opposition of parliament to the electorate. However, in many jurisdictions a head of state may refuse a parliamentary dissolution, requiring the resignation of the prime minister and his or her government. In most modern parliamentary systems, the prime minister is the person who decides when to request a parliamentary dissolution.\n\nOlder constitutions often vest this power in the cabinet. In the United Kingdom, for example, the tradition whereby it is the prime minister who requests a dissolution of parliament dates back to 1918. Prior to then, it was the entire government that made the request. Similarly, though the modern 1937 Irish constitution grants to the Taoiseach the right to make the request, the earlier 1922 Irish Free State Constitution vested the power in the Executive Council (the then name for the Irish cabinet).\n\nSome systems, such as Germany and Spain, require motions of no confidence to be constructive: i.e., they must include the name of an alternative prime minister; if the motion of no confidence is successful, the alternative prime minister automatically takes office in place of the incumbent government, which cannot appeal this replacement to the electorate.\n\nIn Australia, the prime minister is expected to step down if they lose the majority support of their party under a spill motion as have many such as Tony Abbott, Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThe prime minister's executive office is usually called the Office of the Prime Minister or Cabinet Office. The U.K.’s Cabinet Office includes the Prime Minister’s Office. Conversely, some Prime Minister's Offices incorporate the role of Cabinet, while Australia’s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet joins them at par. In Israel, the prime minister's executive office is officially titled the \"Prime Minister's Office\" in English, but the original Hebrew term can also be translated as the Prime Minister's Ministry. The Prime Minister's Department is also used, as is Cabinet Department.\n\nWilfried Martens, who served as Prime Minister of Belgium, described his role as follows:\n\nIn many cases, though commonly used, \"prime minister\" is not the official title of the office-holder. In the Russian constitution, the prime minister is titled Chairman of the government. The Irish prime minister is called the Taoiseach (which is rendered into English as prime minister), in Israel the prime minister is Rosh HaMemshalah, meaning \"head of the government\", and the Spanish prime minister is the President of the Government (Presidente del Gobierno). The head of government of the People's Republic of China is referred to as the Premier of the State Council.[citation needed]\n\nOther common forms include president of the council of ministers (for example in Italy, Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri), President of the Executive Council, or Minister-President. In the Nordic countries the prime minister is called Statsminister, meaning \"Minister of State\". In federations, the head of government of a federated entity (such as the province or territory of Canada, the province of Argentina or the state of Brazil) is most commonly known as the premier, chief minister, governor or minister-president.[citation needed]\n\nIt is convention in the English language to call nearly all national heads of government \"prime minister\" (or sometimes the equivalent term \"premier\"), except in cases where the head of state and head of government are one position (usually a presidency), regardless of the correct title of the head of government as applied in his or her respective country. The few exceptions to the rule are Germany and Austria, whose head of government's title is Federal Chancellor; Monaco, whose head of government is referred to as the Minister of State; and Vatican City, for which the head of government is titled the Secretary of State. A stand-out case is the president of Iran, who is not actually a head of state, but the head of the government of Iran. He is referred to as \"president\" in both the Persian and English languages.\n\nIn non-Commonwealth countries, the prime minister may be entitled to the style of Excellency like a president. In some Commonwealth countries, prime ministers and former prime ministers are styled Honourable or Right Honourable associated with their position (the prime minister of Australia or the prime minister of Canada, for example). In the United Kingdom, the prime minister and former prime ministers are also often styled Honourable or Right Honourable; however, this is not due to their position as head of government, but a privilege of being current members of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council.[18]\n\nIn the UK, where devolved government is in place, the leaders of the Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh Governments are styled First Minister. Between 1921 and 1972, when Northern Ireland had a majority rule Parliament, the head of government was the prime minister of Northern Ireland. In Bangladesh, the prime minister is called Prodhān Montrī, literally meaning \"the head of ministers\" or \"prime minister\". In India, the prime minister is called Pradhān Mantrī, literally meaning \"the head of ministers\" or \"prime minister\". In Pakistan, the prime minister is referred to as Wazir-e-Azam, meaning \"grand vizier\".\n\nThe position, power and status of prime ministers differ depending on the age of the constitution.\n\nAlgeria's constitution (1962) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Algeria.\n\nAustralia's constitution makes no mention of a prime minister of Australia and the office only exists by convention, based on the British model.\n\nBangladesh's constitution clearly outlines the functions and powers of the prime minister, and also details the process of his/her appointment and dismissal.\n\nThe People's Republic of China constitution set a premier just one place below the National People's Congress in China. Premier read as (Simplified Chinese: 总理; pinyin: Zŏnglĭ) in Chinese.\n\nCanada has a 'mixed' or hybrid constitution, partly formally codified and partly uncodified. The codified part originally made no reference whatsoever to a prime minister[19] and still gives no parameters of the office. Instead, their powers, duties, appointment and termination follow uncodified conventions. The Constitution Act, 1867 only establishes the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, to which all federal ministers (among others) are appointed and with Members[note 3] of which the Monarch or their Governor General normally performs executive government (as King- or Governor-in-Council).[20] The Constitution Act, 1982, adds passing reference to the \"Prime Minister of Canada\" [French: premier ministre du Canada] but as detail of conferences of federal and provincial first ministers.)[21]\n\nCzech Republic's constitution clearly outlines the functions and powers of the prime minister of the Czech Republic, and also details the process of his/her appointment and dismissal.\n\nFrance's constitution (1958) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of France.\n\nGermany's Basic Law (1949) lists the powers, functions and duties of the federal chancellor.\n\nGreece's constitution (1975) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Greece.\n\nHungary's constitution (2012) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Hungary.\n\nIndia's constitution (1950) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of India. In India, prime ministerial candidates must be a member of parliament, i.e. of either the Lok Sabha (Lower House) or Rajya Sabha (Upper House). No parliamentary vote takes place on who forms a government.\n\nIreland's constitution (1937), provides for the office of Taoiseach in detail, listing powers, functions and duties.\n\nItaly's constitution (1948) lists the powers, functions and duties of the president of the Council of Ministers.\n\nJapan's constitution (1946) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Japan.\n\nThe Republic of Korea's constitution (1987) sections 86–87 list the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of the Republic of Korea.\n\nMalta's constitution (1964) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Malta.\n\nMalaysia's constitution (1957) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Malaysia.\n\nNorway's constitution (1814) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Norway\n\nPakistan's constitution (1973) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Pakistan.\n\nPoland's constitution (1918) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Poland.\n\nSpain's constitution (1978) regulates the appointment, dismissal, powers, functions and duties of the President of the Government.\n\nSri Lanka's constitution (1978) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Sri Lanka.\n\nThailand's constitution (1932) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Thailand.\n\nTaiwan's constitution (1946) lists the powers, functions and duties of the president of the Executive Yuan.\n\nThe United Kingdom's constitution, being uncodified and largely unwritten, makes no mention of a prime minister. Though it had de facto existed for centuries, its first mention in official state documents did not occur until the first decade of the twentieth century. Accordingly, it is often said \"not to exist\"; indeed there are several instances of parliament declaring this to be the case. The prime minister sits in the cabinet solely by virtue of occupying another office, either First Lord of the Treasury (office in commission) or more rarely Chancellor of the Exchequer (the last of whom was Balfour in 1905).\n\nDuring the period between the time it is clear that the incumbent government has been defeated at a general election, and the actual swearing-in of the new prime minister by the monarch, governor-general, or president, that person is referred to as the \"prime minister-elect\" or \"prime minister-designate\". Neither term is strictly correct from a constitutional point of view, but they have wide acceptance. In a situation in which a ruling party elects or appoints a new leader, the incoming leader will usually be referred as \"prime minister-in-waiting\". An example or this situation was in 2016 in the United Kingdom when Theresa May was elected leader of the Conservative Party while David Cameron was still prime minister.\n\nRussia's constitution (1993) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Russia.\n\nUkraine's constitution (1996) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Ukraine.\n\nThe following table groups the list of past and present prime ministers and details information available in those lists.\n• List of current prime ministers by date of assumption of office\n• List of current heads of state and government\n• Andrew Blick & George Jones, Premiership: The Development, Nature and Power of the Office of the British Prime Minister (Exeter: Imprint Academic, 2010), ISBN 9781845406479.\n• Peter Hennessy, The Prime Minister: The Office and Its Holders Since 1945 (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2001), ISBN 978-0-312-29313-0.\n• Paul Langford, \"Prime Ministers and Parliaments: The Long View, Walpole to Blair.\", The Annual History of Parliament Lecture, 2005, Parliamentary History, 25, 3 (2006): 382–394, doi:10.1353/pah.2006.0045.\n• James Manor, Nehru to the Nineties: The Changing Office of Prime Minister in India (C.

His experiences as a teacher, father, leader, and advocate for youth have shaped his dedication to Canadians.\n\nThe oldest of three boys, Justin grew up with the profound influence of his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and his mother, Margaret Trudeau. He graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1994. He went on to complete the University of British Columbia’s education program, and spent several years teaching in Vancouver.\n\nJustin entered politics to make change that would better serve all Canadians. In 2007, he built a grassroots campaign to win the Liberal Party nomination in the Montréal riding of Papineau. He was elected in 2008, and re-elected in 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2021.\n\nJustin was elected Leader of the Liberal Party in April 2013.

On September 20, 2021, Justin once again led the party to re-election, earning a third mandate to govern from Canadians.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Justin leads a government that works hard to continue moving Canada forward. His team is focused on fighting climate change, creating good middle-class jobs, making life more affordable, keeping Canada’s communities safe, and moving forward on reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.Togo - Wikipedia: Togo,[a] officially the Togolese Republic,[b] is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Ghana to the west, Benin to the east and Burkina Faso to the north.[11] It is one of the least developed countries and extends south to the Gulf of Guinea, where its capital, Lomé, is located.[11] It is a small, tropical country, spanning 57,000 square kilometres (22,000 square miles)[4] with a population of approximately 8 million,[4] and it has a width of less than 115 km (71 mi) between Ghana and its eastern neighbour Benin.[12][13]\n\nVarious peoples settled the boundaries of present day Togo between the 11th and 16th centuries. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the coastal region served primarily as a European slave trading outpost, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The Slave Coast\". In 1884, Germany declared a region including a protectorate called Togoland. After World War I, rule over Togo was transferred to France. Togo gained independence from France in 1960.[2][14] In 1967, Gnassingbé Eyadéma led a successful military coup d'état and became president of an anti-communist, single-party state. In 1993, Eyadéma faced multiparty elections marred by irregularities, and won the presidency three times. At the time of his death, Eyadéma was the \"longest-serving leader in modern African history\", having been president for 38 years.[15] In 2005, his son Faure Gnassingbé was elected president.\n\nTogo is a tropical, sub-Saharan nation[11] whose economy depends mostly on agriculture.[14] The official language is French,[14] but other languages are spoken, particularly those of the Gbe family. 47.8% of the population adhere to Christianity, making it the largest religion in the country.[16] Togo is a member of the United Nations, African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Francophonie, Commonwealth of Nations, and Economic Community of West African States.\n\nArchaeological finds indicate that tribes were able to produce pottery and process iron. The name Togo is translated from the Ewe language as \"behind the river\". During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century, tribes entered the region: the Ewé from the west, and the Mina and Gun from the east. Most of them settled in coastal areas. The Atlantic slave trade began in the 16th century, and for the next two hundred years the coastal region was a trading centre for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The Slave Coast\".\n\nIn 1884, a paper was signed at Togoville with King Mlapa III, whereby Germany claimed a protectorate over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland. Its borders were defined after the capture of hinterland by German forces and signing agreements with France and Britain. In 1905, this became the German colony of Togoland. The local population was forced to work, cultivate cotton, coffee, and cocoa and pay taxes. A railway and the port of Lomé were built for export of agricultural products. The Germans introduced techniques of cultivation of cocoa, coffee and cotton and developed the infrastructure.\n\nDuring the First World War, Togoland was invaded by Britain and France, proclaiming the Anglo-French condominium. The Togoland Campaign involved the successful French and British invasion of the German colony of Togoland during the West African Campaign of the First World War. Following the Allied invasion of the colony in August 1914, German forces were defeated, forcing the colony's surrender on 26 August 1914. On 7 December 1916, the condominium collapsed and Togoland was subsequently partitioned into British and French zones, creating the colonies of British Togoland and French Togoland. On 20 July 1922, Great Britain received the League of Nations mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. In 1945, the country received the right to send three representatives to the French parliament.\n\nAfter World War II, these mandates became UN Trust Territories. The residents of British Togoland voted to join the Gold Coast as part of the independent nation of Ghana in 1957. French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the French Union in 1959, while France retained the right to control defence, foreign relations, and finances.\n\nThe Togolese Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960. In the first presidential elections in 1961, Sylvanus Olympio became the first president, gaining 100% of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition. On 9 April 1961, the Constitution of the Togolese Republic was adopted, according to which the supreme legislative body was the National Assembly of Togo.[17] In December 1961, leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy. A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on France by establishing cooperation with the United States, United Kingdom, and West Germany. He rejected the efforts of French soldiers who were demobilized after the Algerian War and tried to get a position in the Togolese army. These factors eventually led to a military coup on 13 January 1963 during which he was assassinated by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant Gnassingbé Eyadéma.[18] A state of emergency was declared in Togo. The military handed over power to an interim government led by Nicolas Grunitzky. In May 1963, Grunitzky was elected President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with France. His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.\n\nOn 13 January 1967, Eyadéma Gnassingbé overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency.[19] He created the Rally of the Togolese People Party, banned activities of other political parties and introduced a 1-party system in November 1969. He was reelected in 1979 and 1986. In 1983, the privatization program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, EU froze the partnership, describing Eyadema's re-election in 1993, 1998 and 2003, as a seizure of power. In April 2004, in Brussels, talks were held between the European Union and Togo on the resumption of cooperation.\n\nEyadéma Gnassingbé died on Saturday, 5 February 2005. The military's installation of his son, Faure Gnassingbé,[19] as president provoked international condemnation, except from France. Some \"democratically elected\" African leaders such as Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria supported the move, thereby creating a rift within the African Union.[20] Gnassingbé left power and held elections, which he won two months later. The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent. The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to democracy that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with EU which cut off aid in 1993 due to questions about Togo's human rights situation. Up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the UN. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighbouring countries. Gnassingbé was reelected in 2010 and 2015.\n\nTogo became the first African nation to win an Olympic medal in canoeing at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing when Benjamin Boukpeti won bronze in the K-1 slalom.\n\nIn 2017, anti-government protests erupted. UN condemned the resulting crackdown by security forces, and Gambia's foreign minister, Ousainou Darboe, had to issue a correction after saying that Gnassingbé should resign.[21]\n\nIn the February 2020 presidential elections, Faure Gnassingbé won his fourth presidential term in office as the president of Togo.[22] According to the official result, he won with a margin of around 72% of the vote share. This enabled him to defeat his closest challenger, the former prime minister Agbeyome Kodjo who had 18%.[23] On 4 May 2020, Bitala Madjoulba, the commander of a Togolese military battalion, was found dead in his office. The day of Madjoulba's death came after the re-elected Faure Gnassingbé was sworn in for his fourth term. An investigation was opened for this case, resulting in Major General Kadangha Abalo Felix being prosecuted and tried for involvement in Madjoulba's assassination and 'conspiracy against the internal security of the state.' [24][25]\n\nTogo joined the Commonwealth in June 2022.[26] Prior to its admission at the 2022 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Foreign Minister Robert Dussey said that he expected Commonwealth membership to provide new export markets, funding for development projects and opportunities for Togolese citizens to learn English and access new educational and cultural resources.[27]\n\nThe president is elected by universal and direct suffrage for five years, and is the commander of the armed forces and has the right to initiate legislation and dissolve parliament. Executive power is exercised by the president and the government. The head of government is the Prime Minister who is appointed by the president.\n\nPresident Gnassingbé Eyadéma, who ruled Togo under a one-party system, died of a heart attack on 5 February 2005. Under the Togolese Constitution, the President of the Parliament, Fambaré Ouattara Natchaba, should have become president of the country, pending a presidential election to be called within 60 days. Natchaba was out of the country, returning on an Air France plane from Paris.[28] The Togolese army, known as Forces Armées Togolaises (FAT), or Togolese Armed Forces, closed the nation's borders, forcing the plane to land in Benin. With an engineered power vacuum, the Parliament voted to remove the constitutional clause that would have required an election within 60 days and declared that Eyadema's son, Faure Gnassingbé, would inherit the presidency and hold office for the rest of his father's term.[28] Faure was sworn in on 7 February 2005, with international criticism of the succession.[29] The African Union described the takeover as a military coup d'état.[30] International pressure also came from the United Nations. Within Togo, opposition to the takeover culminated in riots in which between 400 and 500 people died.[31] There were uprisings in cities and towns mainly in the southern part of the country. In the town of Aného reports of a general civilian uprising followed by a massacre by government troops. In response, Faure Gnassingbé agreed to hold elections and on 25 February, Gnassingbé resigned as president, and afterward accepted the nomination to run for the office in April.[32]\n\nOn 24 April 2005, Gnassingbé was elected president of Togo, receiving over 60% of the vote according to official results. His main rival in the race had been Emmanuel Bob-Akitani from the Union des Forces du Changement (UFC). Electoral fraud was suspected due to a lack of European Union or other independent oversight.[33] Parliament designated Deputy President, Bonfoh Abbass, as interim president until the inauguration.[32] On 3 May 2005, Faure Gnassingbé was sworn in as the new president and the European Union suspended aid to Togo in support of the opposition claims, unlike the African Union and the United States which declared the vote \"reasonably fair\". The Nigerian president and Chair of AU, Olusẹgun Ọbasanjọ, sought to negotiate between the incumbent government and the opposition to establish a coalition government, and rejected an AU Commission appointment of former Zambian president, Kenneth Kaunda, as special AU envoy to Togo.[34][35] In June, President Gnassingbé named opposition leader Edem Kodjo as the prime minister.\n\nIn October 2007, after postponements, elections were held under proportional representation. This allowed the less populated north to seat as many MPs as the more populated south.[36] The president-backed party Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) won a majority with UFC coming second and the other parties claiming inconsequential representation. Vote rigging accusations were levelled at RPT supported by the civil and military security apparatus. With the presence of an EU observer mission, cancelled ballots and illegal voting took place, the majority of which in RPT strongholds. On 3 December 2007 Komlan Mally of RPT was appointed to prime minister succeeding Agboyibor. On 5 September 2008, Mally resigned as prime minister of Togo.\n\nFaure Gnassingbé won re-election in the March 2010 presidential election, taking 61% of the vote against Jean-Pierre Fabre from UFC, who had been backed by an opposition coalition called FRAC (Republican Front for Change).[37] Electoral observers noted \"procedural errors\" and technical problems, and the opposition did not recognize the results, claiming irregularities had affected the outcome.[38][39] Periodic protests against Faure Gnassingbé followed the election.[40] In May 2010, opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio announced that he would enter into a power-sharing deal with the government, a coalition arrangement which provides UFC with eight ministerial posts.[41][42] In June 2012, electoral reforms prompted protesters to take to the street in Lomé for days; protesters sought a return to the 1992 constitution that would re-establish presidential term limits.[43] July 2012 saw the resignation of the prime minister, Gilbert Houngbo.[44] Days later, the commerce minister, Kwesi Ahoomey-Zunu, was named to lead the new government. In the same month, the home of opposition leader Jean-Pierre Fabre was raided by security forces, and thousands of protesters again rallied publicly against the government crackdown.[45]\n\nIn April 2015, President Faure Gnassingbé was re-elected for a third term.[46] In February 2020, Faure Gnassingbé was again re-elected for his fourth presidential term. The opposition had accusations of fraud and irregularities.[47] The Gnassingbé family has ruled Togo since 1967, meaning it is Africa's longest lasting dynasty.[48]\n\nIn March 2024, President Faure Gnassingbé presented a new constitution. One of the constitutional changes in the new constitution has Togo go from being under a presidential system to being under a parliamentary one, as well as weakening the power of the president, it becoming a mostly ceremonial role, strengthening the power of parliament, and strengthening the power of prime minister and renaming the office \"President of the Council of Ministers\" (French: Président du Conseil des Ministres). The term of the new office will be six years, renewable indefinitely, whereas the term of the president is lowered to four from the previous five, renewable once. In April 2024, the Togolese parliament voted in favour of the new constitution and the new constitution was officially adopted on 6 May 2024.[49]\n\nTogo is divided into 5 regions which are subdivided in turn into 39 prefectures. From north to south the regions are Savanes, Kara, Centrale, Plateaux and Maritime.\n\nWhile Togo's foreign policy is nonaligned, it has historical and cultural ties with western Europe, especially France and Germany. Togo recognizes the People's Republic of China, North Korea, and Cuba. It re-established relations with Israel in 1987. Togo pursues an active foreign policy and participates in international organizations. It is particularly active in West African regional affairs and in the African Union.\n\nIn 2017, Togo signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[50] Togo joined the Commonwealth of Nations, along with Gabon, at the 2022 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda.[26] In joining the Commonwealth, Foreign Minister Robert Dussey told Reuters, the country sought to expand its \"diplomatic, political and economic network\" and to \"forge closer ties with the anglophone world.\"[27]\n\nFAT (Forces armées togolaises, \"Togolese armed forces\"), consists of the army, navy, air force, and gendarmerie. Total military expenditures during the fiscal year of 2005 totalled 1.6% of the country's GDP.[2] Military bases exist in Lomé, Temedja, Kara, Niamtougou, and Dapaong.[51] The current Chief of the General Staff is Brigadier General Titikpina Atcha Mohamed, who took office on 19 May 2009.[52] The air force is equipped with Alpha jets.[53]\n\nTogo was labelled \"Not Free\" by Freedom House from 1972 to 1998 and from 2002 to 2006, and has been categorized as \"Partly Free\" from 1999 to 2001 and from 2007. According to a U.S. State Department report based on conditions in 2010, human rights problems include \"security force use of excessive force, including torture, which resulted in deaths and injuries; official impunity; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detention; lengthy pretrial detention; executive influence over the judiciary; infringement of citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on freedoms of press, assembly, and movement; official corruption; discrimination and violence against women; child abuse, including female genital mutilation (FGM), and sexual exploitation of children; regional and ethnic discrimination; trafficking in persons, especially women and children; societal discrimination against persons with disabilities; official and societal discrimination against homosexual persons; societal discrimination against persons with HIV; and forced labour, including by children.\"[54] Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Togo,[55] with a penalty of one to three years imprisonment.[56]\n\nIt has an area equal to 56,785 km2 (21,925 sq mi). It borders the Bight of Benin in the south; Ghana lies to the west; Benin to the east; and to the north, it is bound by Burkina Faso. North of the equator, it lies mostly between latitudes 6° and 11°N, and longitudes 0° and 2°E.\n\nThe coast of Togo in the Gulf of Guinea is 56 km (35 miles) long and consists of lagoons with sandy beaches. In the north, the land is characterized by a rolling savanna in contrast to the centre of the country, which is characterized by hills. The south of Togo is characterized by a savanna and woodland plateau which reaches a coastal plain with lagoons and marshes. The highest mountain of the country is the Mont Agou at 986 metres (3235') above sea level. The longest river is the Mono River with a length of 400 km (250 miles). It runs from north to south.\n\nThe climate is \"generally tropical\"[14] with average temperatures ranging from 23 °C (73 °F) on the coast to about 30 °C (86 °F) in the northernmost regions, with a drier climate and characteristics of a tropical savanna.\n\nTogo contains three terrestrial ecoregions: Eastern Guinean forests, Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, and West Sudanian savanna.[57] The coast of Togo is characterized by marshes and mangroves. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.88/10, ranking it 92nd globally out of 172 countries.[58]\n\nAt least five parks and reserves have been established: Abdoulaye Faunal Reserve, Fazao Malfakassa National Park, Fosse aux Lions National Park, Koutammakou,[59] and Kéran National Park.\n\nThe country possesses phosphate deposits[14] and an export sector based on agricultural products such as coffee, cocoa bean, and peanuts (groundnuts), which together generate roughly 30% of export earnings.[14] Cotton is a cash crop.[60] The fertile land occupies 11.3% of the country, most of which is developed. Some crops are cassava, jasmine rice, maize and millet. Some other sectors are brewery and the textile industry. Low market prices for Togo's major export commodities coupled with the volatile political situation of the 1990s and 2000s had a negative effect on the economy.[61]\n\nIt is listed in the least developed country group. It serves as a regional commercial and trade centre. The government's decade-long efforts supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to carry out economic reforms, to encourage investments, and to create the balance between income and consumption has stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrank the tax base, and disrupted economic activities in the country.[citation needed] Togo was ranked 117th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[62]\n\nIt imports machinery, equipment, petroleum products, and food. Its main import partners are France (21.1%), the Netherlands (12.1%), Côte d'Ivoire (5.9%), Germany (4.6%), Italy (4.4%), South Africa (4.3%) and China (4.1%). The main exports are cocoa, coffee, re-export of goods, phosphates and cotton. \"Major export partners\" are Burkina Faso (16.6%), China (15.4%), the Netherlands (13%), Benin (9.6%) and Mali (7.4%).\n\nIn terms of structural reforms, it has made progress in the liberalization of the economy, namely in the fields of trade and port activities. The privatization program of the cotton sector, telecommunications and water supply has stalled.\n\nOn 12 January 1994, the devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an impetus to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. Progress depends on increased openness in government financial operations (to accommodate increased social service outlays) and possible downsizing of the armed forces, on which the regime has depended to stay in place. Lack of aid and depressed cocoa prices generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with growth resuming in 1999. Togo is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).[63]\n\nAgriculture is the \"backbone\" of the economy.[14] A shortage of funds for the purchase of irrigation equipment and fertilizers has reduced agricultural output. Agriculture generated 28.2% of GDP in 2012 and employed 49% of the working population in 2010. The country is essentially self-sufficient in food production. Livestock production is dominated by cattle breeding.[64][65]\n\nMining generated about 33.9% of GDP in 2012 and employed 12% of the population in 2010. Togo's gold production in 2015 is 16 metric tons.[66] Togo has the fourth-largest phosphate deposits in the world. Their production is 2.1 million tons per year. There are reserves of limestone, marble and salt. Industry provides 20.4% of Togo's national income, as it consists of light industries and builders. Some reserves of limestone allows Togo to produce cement.[64][67]\n\nTogo has a road network of 7,520 km (4,670 mi) as of 2000, with no updated data as of 2023. It has only two major highways, Highway N1 and N2, connecting the capital, Lomé with the city of Dapaong, where it gets diverged northwards to Burkina Faso and from there north-west to Mali, and north-east to Niger. N1 is the longest highway of Togo, at a length of 613 km (381 mi). N2 connects Lomé with Aneho. The extension of N2 is Highway RNIE1, or the Trans–West African Coastal Highway, from Aneho to Cotonou in Benin. Other roads and highways are local and regional roads in the rest of the country, also passing through borders with the neighbouring countries. The Trans–West African Coastal Highway crosses Togo, connecting it to Benin and Nigeria to the east, and Ghana and Ivory Coast to the west. Once the construction in Liberia and Sierra Leone part gets completed, the highway will continue west to seven other Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) nations.\n\nTogo has a railway network of 568 km (353 mi) as of 2008, with no further updates in the network as of 2023. It follows a track gauge of 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) (narrow gauge) Trains are operated by Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Togolais (SNCT), which was established as a result of the restructuring and renaming of Réseau des Chemins de Fer du Togo from 1997 to 1998.[68] Between Hahotoé and the port of Kpémé, the Compagnie Togolaise des Mines du Bénin (CTMB) operated phosphate trains.[68]\n\nThe following are the railway networks present in the country:\n\nTogo has a total of eight airports, as of 2012, out of which two are international airports and six are domestic airports. The only major airport of the country is Lomé–Tokoin International Airport serving the capital, Lomé, and another Niamtougou International Airport in Niamtougou, serving the country's northern part.\n\nTogo, in terms of water transport, is only 50 km (31 mi) navigable, mostly seasonally on the Mono River, depending on rainfall, as of 2011. Togo has only one large container port for carrying trade operations in and out of the country, the Port of Lomé, in the capital.\n\nThe November 2010 census gave Togo a population of 6,191,155, more than double the total counted in the last census; in 2022 the Togo population was 8,680,832.[69] That census, taken in 1981, showed the nation had a population of 2,719,567. The capital, Lomé, grew from 375,499 in 1981 to 837,437 in 2010. When the urban population of surrounding Golfe prefecture is added, the Lomé Agglomeration contained 1,477,660 residents in 2010.[70][71]\n\nOther cities in Togo according to the new census were Sokodé (95,070), Kara (94,878), Kpalimé (75,084), Atakpamé (69,261), Dapaong (58,071) and Tsévié (54,474). With an estimated population of 8,644,829 (as of 2021 ), Togo is the 107th largest country by population. Most of the population (65%) live in rural villages dedicated to agriculture or pastures. The population of Togo shows a stronger growth: from 1961 (the year after independence) to 2003 it quintupled.[70][71]\n\nIn Togo, there are about 40 different ethnic groups, the most numerous of which are the Ewe in the south who make up 32% of the population. Along the southern coastline, they account for 21% of the population. Also found are Kotokoli or Tem and Tchamba in the centre and the Kabye people in the north (22%). The Ouatchis [fr] are 14% of the population. Sometimes the Ewes and Ouatchis are considered the same, while the French who studied both groups considered them different people.[73] Other ethnic groups include the Mina, Mossi, the Moba and Bassar, the Tchokossi of Mango (about 8%).\n\nAccording to a 2012 US government religious freedoms report, in 2004 the University of Lomé estimated that 33% of the population were traditional animists, 28% were Roman Catholic, 20% Sunni Muslim, 9% Protestant and another 5% belonged to other Christian denominations. The remaining 5% were reported to include persons not affiliated with any religious group. The report noted that \"many\" Christians and Muslims continue to perform indigenous religious practices.[75]\n\nIn 2023, The World Factbook stated that 42.3% of the population was Christian and 14% Muslim, with 36.9% being followers of indigenous beliefs, less than one percent being Hindus, Jews, and followers of other religions, and 6.2% being unaffiliated.[64]\n\nChristianity began to spread from the middle of the 15th century, after the arrival of Portuguese Catholic missionaries. Germans introduced Protestantism in the second half of the 19th century when a hundred missionaries of the Bremen Missionary Society were sent to the coastal areas of Togo and Ghana. Togo's Protestants were known as \"Brema\", a corruption of the word \"Bremen\". After World War I, German missionaries had to leave, which gave birth to the early autonomy of the Ewe Evangelical Church.[76]\n\nIn 2022, Freedom House rated Togo's religious freedom as 3 out of 4,[77] noting that religious freedom is constitutionally protected and generally respected in practice. Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism are recognised by the state; other groups must register as religious associations to receive similar benefits. The registration process has been subject to long delays with almost 900 applications pending at the beginning of 2021.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, 39 distinct languages are spoken in the country, some of them by communities that number fewer than 100,000 members.[78] Of the 39 languages, the sole official language is French.[79] Two spoken indigenous languages were designated politically as national languages in 1975: Ewé (Ewe: Èʋegbe; French: Evé) and Kabiyé.[79]\n\nThough not native to most groups, French is used in formal education, legislature, all forms of media, administration and commerce. Ewe is a language of wider communication in the south. Tem functions to a limited extent as a trade language in some northern towns.[80] Officially, Ewe and Kabiye are \"national languages\", which in the Togolese context means languages that are promoted in formal education and used in the media. Others are Gen, Aja, Moba, Ntcham, and Ife. In joining the Commonwealth, the Togolese government has anticipated opportunities for Togolese citizens to learn English.[27]\n\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative[81] finds that Togo is fulfilling 73.1% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to health based on its level of income.[82] When looking at the right to health with respect to children, Togo achieves 93.8% of what is expected based on its current income.[82] In regards to the right to health amongst the adult population, the country achieves 88.2% of what is expected based on the nation's level of income.[82] It falls into the \"very bad\" category when evaluating the right to reproductive health because the nation is fulfilling 37.3% of what the nation is expected to achieve based on the resources (income) it has available.[82]\n\nHealth expenditure in Togo was 5.2% of GDP in 2014, which ranks the country in 45th place in the world.[64] The infant mortality rate is approximately 43.7 deaths per 1,000 children in 2016.[64] Male life expectancy at birth was at 62.3 in 2016, whereas it was at 67.7 years for females.[64] There were 5 physicians per 100,000 people in 2008[64] According to a 2013 UNICEF report,[83] 4% of women in Togo have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\nAs of 2015 , the maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Togo is 368, compared with 350 in 2010 and 539.7 in 1990.[64] The under 5 mortality rate per 1,000 births is 100, and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 32. In Togo the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 2 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 67.[84]\n\nIn 2016, Togo had 4100 (2400-6100) new HIV infections and 5100 (3100-7700) AIDS-related deaths. There were 100,000 (73,000-130,000) people living with HIV in 2016, among whom 51% (37-67%) were accessing antiretroviral therapy. Among pregnant women living with HIV, 86% (59% - >95%) were accessing treatment or prophylaxis to prevent transmission of HIV to their children. An estimated <1000 (<500-1400) children were newly infected with HIV due to mother-to-child transmission. Among people living with HIV, approximately 42% (30-55%) had suppressed viral loads.[85]\n\nAFD is working to enhance living conditions in Lomé, the coastal city with a population of 1.4 million, by modernizing solid waste management services. The project involves enhancing garbage collection through the construction of a new landfill that meets international standards.[86][87]\n\nIn 2024, a Universal Health Insurance program was launched, covering 800,000 people within six months and implemented through the National Social Security Fund and the National Health Insurance Institute.[88]\n\nEducation in Togo is compulsory for six years.[89] In 1996, the gross primary enrollment rate was 119.6%, and the net primary enrollment rate was 81.3%.[89] In 2011, the net enrollment rate was 94%. The education system has \"suffered from teacher shortages, lower educational quality in rural areas, and high repetition and dropout rates\".[89]\n\nThe culture reflects the influences of ethnic groups, the largest of which are the Ewe, Mina, Tem, Tchamba and Kabre. Some people follow native animistic practices and beliefs.\n\nEwe statuary is characterized by its statuettes which illustrate the worship of the ibeji. Sculptures and hunting trophies were used rather than the \"more ubiquitous\" African masks. The wood-carvers of Kloto has their \"chains of marriage\": Two characters are connected by rings whittled from one piece of wood.\n\nThe dyed fabric batiks of the artisanal centre of Kloto represent stylized and coloured scenes of ancient everyday life. There are loincloths used in the ceremonies of the weavers of Assahoun. Works of the painter Sokey Edorh are inspired by the \"immense arid extents, swept by the dry wind\", and where the soil keeps the prints of the men and the animals. The plastics technician Paul Ahyi practiced the \"zota\", a kind of pyroengraving, and his monumental achievements decorate Lomé.\n\nBasketball is Togo's \"second most practiced sport\".[90] Togo featured a national team in beach volleyball that competed at the 2018–2020 CAVB Beach Volleyball Continental Cup in the men's section.[91]\n\nMass media in Togo includes radio, television, and online and print formats. The Agence Togolaise de Presse [fr] news agency began in 1975.[92] The Union des Journalistes Independants du Togo press association is headquartered in Lomé.[92]Togolese Television is the state-owned service.Togo country profile: Faure Gnassingbe Eyadema succeeded his father, who died in 2005 after ruling the country with an iron fist for 38 years.\n\nThe military installed Faure Gnassingbe as president, but after demonstrations and protests in which hundreds died, as well as international pressure, he held an election in April 2005 that he subsequently won.\n\nGnassingbe was re-elected in 2010, 2015 and 2020. All of the elections have been criticised by the opposition, who have alleged instances of widespread fraud.\n\nIn 2024, Togo's parliament gave final approval to a new constitution extending the president's term. The country will move from a presidential to a parliamentary system.\n\nPresident Gnassingbé's supporters argue the changes reduce his powers by transforming the presidency into a ceremonial role.\n\nCritics have denounced the move as a coup, arguing that the reforms remove limits on his stay in office and their removal enables him to remain president until 2031, after which he could be appointed to the new position of \"president of the council of ministers\", in effect prime minister."}

Quan Àrtemis i els seus companys a Letrinos van anar cap a Alfeu, ella va sospitar dels seus motius i es va cobrir la cara amb fang perquè no la reconegués. En una altra història, Alfeu intenta violar l'assistent d'Àrtemis, Aretusa . Àrtemis es compadeix de la noia i la salva, transformant-la en una font al temple Artemis Alphaea de Letrinos, on van beure la deessa i la seva assistent.\n\nSe li atribueix la mort de Cal·listo , que va morir per una fletxa perquè Hera ho va demanar o per castigar-la per haver-se deixat seduir per Zeus quan Cal·listo va ser transformada en ossa.\n\nEntre les seves víctimes trobem Orió , el caçador gegant. Les tradicions difereixen sobre el motiu de la deessa per matar-lo. Unes diuen que Orió va fer entrar en còlera a Àrtemis per haver-la desafiat en el llançament del disc, o bé altres expliquen que Orió va voler raptar una de les companyes d'Àrtemis, Opis, a qui ella havia fet venir del país dels hiperboris . O també es deia que Orió va intentar violar la mateixa Àrtemis, i per això la deessa li va enviar un escorpí que el va picar i el va matar.\n\nEls fills bessons de Posidó i Ifimedia , Otos i Efialtes , van créixer enormement a una edat jove. Eren uns caçadors agressius i hàbils que no podien ser assassinats excepte entre ells. El creixement dels aloïdes no es va aturar mai, i van presumir que tan bon punt poguessin arribar al cel, segrestarien Àrtemis i Hera i les prendrien com a dones. Els déus els tenien por, llevat d'Àrtemis que va capturar un cabirol que va saltar entre ells i es van matar intentant caçar-lo. [21]\n\nÀrtemis va salvar l'infant Atalanta de morir per hipotèrmia després que el seu pare l'abandonés. Va enviar una óssa per alletar el nadó, que després va ser criat pels caçadors. En algunes històries, Àrtemis després va enviar un ós per ferir Atalanta perquè d'altres afirmaven que Atalanta era una caçadora superior. Entre altres aventures, Atalanta va participar en la caça del senglar de Calidó , que Àrtemis havia enviat per destruir Calidó perquè el rei Eneu l'havia oblidat en els sacrificis de la collita .\n\nQuan la flota grega es preparava a Àulida per marxar cap a Troia per començar la guerra, Àrtemis va calmar els vents. El vident Calcant va aconsellar erròniament a Agamèmnon que l'única manera d'apaivagar Àrtemis era sacrificar la seva filla Ifigenia. En alguna versió del mite, Àrtemis va arrabassar Ifigenia de l'altar i la va substituir per un cérvol; en altres, Àrtemis va permetre que es sacrifiqués Ifigenia. En les versions on Ifigenia va sobreviure, s'han explicat diversos mites sobre el que va passar després que Àrtemis la prengués; o bé la van portar a Taures i la va portar als sacerdots, o es va convertir en la companya immortal d'Àrtemis.[45] Enees també va ser ajudat per Àrtemis, Leto i Apol·lo. Apol·lo el va trobar ferit per Diomedes i el va aixecar al cel. Allà, les tres divinitats el van curar en secret en una gran cambra.\n\nDurant la teomàquia, Àrtemis es va trobar davant d'Hera, sobre la qual un escoli a la Ilíada va escriure que representaven la Lluna enfront de l'aire al voltant de la Terra.[46] Àrtemis va renyar al seu germà Apol·lo per no lluitar contra Posidó i li va dir que no tornés a presumir mai més; Apol·lo no li va respondre. Una enfadada Hera va retreure a Àrtemis per haver-se atrevit a lluitar amb ella. Llavors Hera va agafar les mans d'Artemisa pels canells i, subjectant-la, la va colpejar amb el seu propi arc.[47] Plorant, Àrtemis va deixar l'arc i les fletxes on estaven i va córrer cap a l'Olimp per plorar als genolls del seu pare Zeus, mentre la seva mare Leto agafava l'arc i les fletxes i seguia la seva filla plorant.[48]"}

The average elevation is 338 m, with a minimum of 20 m and a maximum of 533 m. Favara is part of the agricultural region #5 Agrigento seaside hills (Italian: Colline litoranee di Agrigento). The local climate falls into the Csa category of the Köppen climate classification, i.e. a warm Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and temperate winters, with temperature rarely dropping below 0 °C.\n\nThe first signs of human habitation of the area can be dated to the late copper age (2400-1990 a.C.), with monochrome red pottery in the Malpasso style found in a cave in contrada Ticchiara. An excavation of a later burial site (1900-1450 a.C.) from contrada Grazia Vicina has yielded gray achromatic ceramic with connection to the Conca d'Oro style (late copper age in the Palermo region) and to archaic forms of the Castelluccio style (early Bronze Age in central-southern Sicily). Another burial site has been identified in contrada San Vincenzo, which can be dated to the middle Bronze Age (around 1450 a.C.).\n\nRemains of a fortification dating to the period of the Greek colonies in Sicily can be found in Contrada Caltafaraci. Following the Roman and Byzantine domination, the Saracen established themselves in Sicily in the 9th and 10th century. A settlement flourished in contrada Saraceno and many traces of their domination can still be found in the denomination of local geographical places. The name of the town itself originates from the Arabian fawwāra (Arabic: ﻓﻮﺍﺭة), meaning \"Gurgling pool of water\".[4]\n\nDuring the subsequent Norman domination several large structures were built, among others the Chiaramonte Castle, also known as the Medieval Palace. In the 14th century the castle passed to the Chiaramonte family, from which it took its current name. In the 15th century, although protected by city walls, the town underwent a period of population decline, especially between 1439 and 1464. This trend was reversed from 1478 to 1497. In the 16th century the efforts of the De Marinis family contributed to a greater development of Favara.\n\nIn the 19th century, in the background of the unification of Italy and up to 1883, Favara was the main hub of a large criminal organization known as Fratellanza di Favara.\n\nIn contemporary history, the mayor of Favara, Gaetano Guarino, was murdered on May 16, 1946, by unknown perpetrators.\n\nCalogero Marrone (1889-1945), Righteous Among the Nations, was born and raised in Favara.\n\nThe town possesses a Castle of the 11th- to 15th-century noble Chiaramonte family, erected in 1280.[3]Jeremiah Favara, Ph.D.: Monday: 10:00am - 11:00am\n\n Wednesday: 9:00am - 11:00am\n\n Thursday: 10:00am to 11:00am\n\n or by appointmentPresident Favara: Dr. Favara first became acquainted with Central Christian College of Kansas when he attended Central College as a student in 1987. During that time, he was a member of the Cross Country team and served on Student Government as the Christian Life Director. He graduated both with an Associate of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Ministry.\n\nOver the past 20 years, Favara has served under a number of titles including Coach, Dean, Professor, Pastor, Provost, and now President. During that time, Favara also completed a Master of Science from Kansas State University and then went on to complete a Doctorate in Philosophy in Psychology, with a specialization in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, from Northcentral University in Scottsdale, AZ.\n\nIn the local community, “Lenny” has been a proud supporter of McPherson and the surrounding area. Currently, he serves on the Hospital Board and the United Way Board. Though, if asked, he would tell you that some of his most enjoyable memories stem from his time with the McPherson Community Theatre directing such favorites as Wizard of Oz, My Fair Lady, Honk, and Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat. When not directing from behind the scenes, you may find him down at the Cosmosphere where he volunteers in the education department.\n\nDemonstrating a deep commitment to student success and a great appreciation for the college’s historical context and mission, Dr. Favara is passionate about guiding the college and preparing it for its next 135 years of service. His first year at the helm has been one defined by growth, excitement, and service.\n\nDr. Favara is married to Dr. Deanna (Martin) Favara, daughter of Kenneth, CC’61, and Vida Martin. Having served in a number of roles at Central Christian including Administrative Assistant to Student Development, Resident Director Online Instructor, and Director of Dual-Credit, “Dea” now looks forward to serving the campus community as First Lady. Having met at Central Christian, the two recently celebrated their 30th anniversary. They have two children: Jeremiah & Joseph.Giovanni Favara: Please enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser or access the information through the links provided below."}

El plumaje, muy denso, presenta una coloración marrón oscura en las regiones dorsales y blancuzca en las ventrales (dibujo 1). Similar en ambos sexos, sufre algunas variaciones a lo largo del año y en los individuos juveniles. En plumaje invernal, la cabeza muestra las mejillas y la garganta de color blanco sobre el que destaca una tenue franja oscura que corre a partir del ojo (dibujo 2). Algunas aves muestran un anillo ocular blanco, que resalta vivamente sobre el tono oscuro de la cabeza y que se prolonga en una delgada línea blanca por detrás del ojo. Los ejemplares que presentan este diseño reciben el nombre de araos bridados. Como otros álcidos, el arao desarrolla un vuelo muy directo mediante rápidos aleteos (dibujo 3).\n\nHasta los años sesenta del pasado siglo se contaba con una población nidificante relativamente importante, que se reproducía en las islas y acantilados del litoral gallego. En la actualidad, las dos colonias de arao común que existían en Galicia en el II Atlas de aves reproductoras (1998-2002, Martí y Del Moral, 2003), han desaparecido y aparentemente la especie ya no se reproduce en España. Sí es posible avistar la especie en los pasos y la invernada, cuando nos visitan aves del norte de Europa para alimentarse mar adentro en litoral cantábrico y atlántico gallego. Para más información sobre su distribución territorial y otros datos de interés, consulta la ficha del arao común en el III Atlas de las aves en época de reproducción en España.\n\nEl arao común muestra un comportamiento básicamente dispersivo, en especial los jóvenes, que pueden llegar a realizar desplazamientos de cierta relevancia que los llevan a recalar en localidades bastante alejadas de sus lugares de cría, como lo demuestra el hecho de que se registren aves inmaduras procedentes de las islas Británicas en las costas cantábricas y atlánticas de la Península durante el invierno. Los adultos, sin embargo, permanecen a lo largo de la estación desfavorable en las cercanías de las colonias de cría.\n\nLa Lista Roja Europea de Aves 2021 estima una población europea de entre 3 y 4,4 millones de individuos, con tendencia creciente. España albergaba hasta los años sesenta del pasado siglo unos 3.000 ejemplares, distribuidos en ocho localidades de cría. Tras una disminución espectacular, en 1990 quedaban tan solo 10 parejas reproductoras. En la actualidad la población reproductora está prácticamente extinta, siendo los indicios de reproducción muy débiles y aislados.\n\nSe alimenta de una gran variedad de peces pequeños y medianos (arenques, sardinas, boquerones, fanecas), que localiza mientras prospecta el agua con la cabeza sumergida hasta detectar algún banco; en ese momento se zambulle y, tras una persecución, captura su presa, a la que engulle antes de subir a la superficie. Durante el periodo reproductor, el ave transporta el pez hasta el nido para alimentar a su único pollo.\n\nCría en nutridas colonias junto a otras especies de aves marinas en acantilados costeros, donde utiliza los mismos emplazamientos de unas temporadas a otras. Al inicio del periodo reproductor, los machos, tras pasar todo el invierno en el mar, toman posesión de algún lugar apropiado para criar, generalmente a escasa distancia de sus vecinos, en espera de la llegada de su compañera. No construye nido, sino que utiliza las repisas de los acantilados, la superficie de rocas planas y grietas o cuevecillas entre las rocas, en las que, a lo sumo, deposita algunas pequeñas piedras. La puesta consta de un solo huevo grande y piriforme (para evitar que ruede), de superficie rugosa y color variable (blanco, azul, verde, crema o pardo), sin manchas o con motas o listas. Para incubarlo, ambos adultos lo mantienen entre las patas y el vientre a lo largo de 28-35 días. El pollo es atendido por sus padres durante unos 14-20 días desde su nacimiento, que resulta bastante sincrónico con respecto a los del resto de la colonia para favorecer el éxito reproductor. Transcurrido este tiempo, el pequeño arao tendrá que superar una prueba crucial, que consiste en lanzarse al mar desde la repisa del acantilado donde nació. El padre, que vigila la maniobra, se lanza a continuación y, una vez juntos, se dirigen mar adentro nadando o buceando. Durante algún tiempo más, el padre se encarga de facilitar alimento y protección al joven arao, hasta que alcance su desarrollo completo y se independice.\n\nMeses en los que se puede ver la especie en España\n\nLa especie se incluye en el Libro Rojo de las Aves de España 2021 en la categoría de CR – En peligro crítico. También aparece en el Catálogo Nacional de Especies Amenazadas como EN – En peligro de Extinción como reproductora. La población de arao común ha experimentado un acusado descenso en casi toda su área de distribución europea, como consecuencia de las actuaciones humanas. Por lo que respecta a España, la situación de la población reproductora es crítica. Los últimos indicios de cría en las islas Sisargas son del 2004, y en los islotes del cabo Vilán del 2013 cuando se observaron tres aves en época de cría. En 2017 se realizó un trabajo específico de censo y no se observaron araos en ninguna de las dos localidades. En las islas Berlangas, en las que a mediados de siglo XX las parejas se contabilizaban por miles, ha desaparecido por completo. El declive de la especie se ha debido a diversas causas, entre las que destacan la mortalidad por artes de pesca, la desaparición de la anchoa —uno de los peces más importante en su dieta— por sobrepesca y la contaminación por petróleo.

Il s’engage, à l’âge de seize ans, dans l’armée et sert trois ans en Dalmatie.\n\nRentré à Venise, il se bâtit bientôt une réputation d’homme d’esprit grâce, notamment, à la publication de plusieurs pièces satiriques qui font de lui l’un des membres les plus distingués de la société savante et joyeuse des Granelleschi (les Ineptes). Cette société, attachée en principe à la convivialité et aux mots d’esprit, a de grandes ambitions littéraires et s’attache, tout particulièrement, à préserver la littérature toscane des influences étrangères.\n\nLe déclin de la comédie italienne, la commedia dell'arte en vogue pendant plus de trois siècles dans toute la péninsule, au profit des drames de Pietro Chiari et des œuvres réalistes de Carlo Goldoni, imités du théâtre français, menace de ruiner les efforts de la société ; en 1757, Gozzi se porte à son secours en imaginant de mettre à la scène les contes féeriques tirés de vieux recueils populaires, tels que Lo Cunto del li Cunti. Il publie un poème satirique, La Tartana degli influssi per l’anno 1756, et, en 1761, une comédie, L’Amour des trois oranges ou Analisi riflessiva della fiaba L’amore delle tre melarance, une parodie dans la manière de ses deux concurrents, fondée sur une intrigue féerique, où les masques font leur réapparition. Pour les jouer, il obtient les services de la compagnie de comédiens Sacchi, qui, à cause de la popularité des comédies de Chiari et de Goldoni - qui ne correspond pas à leur style de jeu - se trouvait sans emploi. Leur force satirique, aiguisée par une inimitié personnelle, fit de la pièce un extraordinaire succès, contraignant Goldoni à venir en France trouver un public.\n\nMotivé par l’effet qu’a produit l’introduction du surnaturel ou d’éléments mythiques pourtant simplement employés pour leur potentiel satirique, Gozzi crée une série de neuf fables. Dans ses textes, il ne trace que l’intrigue, et laisse le dialogue à l’improvisation. Ses pièces laissent souvent une place importante à la fantaisie et au fantastique. Ses œuvres restent celles d’un aristocrate cultivé dont les fables ont finalement été oubliées. Gozzi a écrit, pour le théâtre de Venise, dix comédies fiabesques ou Fables théâtrales. Outre L’Amour des trois oranges (1761), peuvent être énumérés les titres suivants : Le Corbeau, en cinq actes (1761) ; Le Roi Cerf, en trois actes (1762) ; Turandot, fable tragi-comique en cinq actes (1762) ; La Femme serpent (1762) ; La Zobéide (1763) ; Les Mendiants fortunés (1764) ; Le Monstre bleu, en cinq actes (1764)[1] ; L’Oiseau vert (1765) ; Zéïm, roi des Génies (1765). Ces pièces est sont en vers, en dehors de la première.\n\nVers la fin de sa vie, Gozzi écrit des tragédies comprenant une dimension comique : innovation si mal accueillie par les critiques que le dramaturge se tourne vers le drame espagnol, qui lui sert de modèle pour plusieurs pièces, au succès mineur. Avec des ouvrages d’une certaine diversité, Gozzi plut par l’esprit, la verve et l’habileté. Forcé de conserver les vieux types représentant les diverses nationalités italiennes : Pantalon le Vénitien, Tartaglia le Napolitain, Brighella le Bergamasque, etc., il leur donne des rôles de généraux, d’ambassadeurs, de ministres, où ils portent leur bonhomie habituelle, et sauvent les situations par leur gaieté. Parmi ces comédies, L’Amour des trois oranges est surtout remarquable comme protestation et satire littéraire. Turandot, princesse de la Chine, dont le sujet est étrange, mais non féerique, a été traduit par Schiller et souvent jouée en Allemagne avec le même succès qu’elle obtint à Venise au théâtre San-Samuel. L’accueil favorable fait à des compositions qui semblent le produit d’une littérature retournant à l'émerveillement de l'enfance s’explique par la réaction, dont Gozzi donne le signal, contre la comédie larmoyante ou commedia fiebile, importée de France en Italie, par Goldoni et Chiari.\n\nGozzi est encore auteur d’une vingtaine de comédies, la plupart d’imitation espagnole, empruntées à José de Cordova, Matos Fragoso, Calderón, Moreto y Cavana, Cañizares, Rojas, Tirso de Molina. L’une de ces pièces, La Vedova del Malabar, est tirée de la tragédie française de Lemierre. Les Œuvres de Gozzi comprennent en outre Marfisa bisarra, une composition romanesque en douze chants et en octaves, prétendument tirée de la Chronique du Pseudo-Turpin ; un poème moral et satirique de 700 vers intitulé : Astrazione ; une traduction en vers élégants, non rimés, des Satires de Boileau ; divers morceaux critiques ou académiques en vers ou en prose.\n\nUn peu oubliées dans sa patrie, les comédies fiabesques de Gozzi sont connues en France par la traduction de M. A. Royer de cinq d’entre elles : Le Corbeau, Le Roi Cerf, Turandot, en vers ; La Zobéide, L’Oiselet vert (Paris, 1865, in-12)[2]. Prisé de Goethe, Schlegel, Germaine de Staël, Sismondi et Schiller (qui a traduit Turandot), le théâtre de Gozzi connaît un immense retentissement parmi les romantiques allemands. E.T.A. Hoffmann le cite expressément comme un modèle dans La Princesse Brambilla.\n\nDes compositeurs se sont inspirés de Gozzi pour leurs livrets d'opéra :\n• L’Amour des trois oranges (1761), la plus célèbre des pièces de Gozzi (elle-même basée sur le conte des Trois cédrats, de Giambattista Basile), a inspiré Sergueï Prokofiev pour son opéra du même nom (1921) ;\n• La Femme Serpent (1762) a inspiré Richard Wagner pour son opéra de jeunesse Les Fées (1834) et Alfredo Casella pour son opéra La donna serpente (1932) ;\n• Turandot (1762) a inspiré Ferruccio Busoni (1917) et Giacomo Puccini (1926) pour leurs opéras du même nom.\n• Le Corbeau, deuxième fable théâtrale de Gozzi (1761), a inspiré Hans Christian Andersen et le compositeur danois Johann Peter Emilius Hartmann pour son opéra Ravnen, en trois actes, créé en 1832 à Copenhague, révisé en 1859 et 1863.\n• Le Roi Cerf a inspiré Hans Werner Henze pour son opéra König Hirsch (1956).\n\nGozzi a réalisé lui-même une édition de ses Œuvres (Venise, 1772, 8 vol. in-8° ; supplément, 1791, 2 vol.), suivie d’une édition en 10 volumes (Venise, 1792). Il a également laissé de très intéressants Mémoires inutiles. Il est également traducteur. Il commence par traduire le roman de Marivaux Le Pharsamon ou les nouvelles folies romanesques, sous le titre Il Farsamone, publié sans nom de traducteur en 1751, pour perfectionner son français.

Ces ouvrages n'ont jamais été traduits dans notre langue, car ils sont écrits pour partie en dialecte vénitien. […] Gozzi méritait bien, comme on dit, les honneurs d'une traduction… » Alphonse Royer avait raison de se lancer en 1865 dans la traduction de cinq des dix fables du comte Carlo Gozzi sous le titre Théâtre fiabesque : il s'agit d’un genre totalement nouveau, inventé par Gozzi pour triompher de son rival honni, Carlo Goldoni, où il mêle avec bonheur le tragique, le pathétique et le comique, dans des intrigues merveilleuses tirées des contes de nourrices. Mais la traduction de ces fables théâtrales ne va pas de soi : car, outre les difficultés posées par le dialecte vénitien, le traducteur est confronté à une « écriture-centaure » mise au point par l’auteur dans la première édition de 1772, où les scènes entièrement dialoguées, en prose en et en vers, en italien et en dialecte, alternent avec des scènes-canevas propres au jeu improvisé des acteurs italiens. Les traductions destinées à la scène ne peuvent jamais restituer cette particularité de l’original, seule une traduction à lire peut lui rendre justice. C’est le but que se fixe cette traduction de la neuvième fable gozzienne, la plus aboutie, L’Oiseau vert (1765), où l’auteur se plaît à donner une suite aux aventures racontées dans la première, L’Amour des trois oranges (1761).Turandot (Busoni) — Wikipédia: Turandot (BV 273 (en)) est un opéra en deux actes avec dialogues parlés de Ferruccio Busoni (1917). Le compositeur rédigea son propre livret en allemand en s'inspirant de la pièce Turandot (en) du comte Carlo Gozzi. La musique de l'opéra repose sur la musique de scène et la suite (en) (BV 248) connexe que Busoni a composées en 1905 pour une production de la pièce de Gozzi. L'opéra est souvent interprété avec l'opéra en un acte précédent de Busoni, Arlecchino.\n\nLa pièce Turandot (en) de Carlo Gozzi fut jouée la première fois en 1762. Elle est créée à l'origine pour être représentée dans le petit théâtre San Samuele de Venise et écrite délibérément dans le style de la commedia dell'arte en réaction aux pièces réalistes plus modernes de Goldoni et d'autres[1].\n\nSchiller fait une traduction adaptée de Turandot qui est publiée en 1802[2]. Weber compose, en 1809, sa musique de scène Turandot, Op. 37, pour une production de cette pièce. Il y inclut l'Overtura cinese (ouverture chinoise), qu'il a composée sur un thème chinois en 1805. Busoni pense qu'à eux deux, Schiller et Weber ont ruiné un chef-d'œuvre de la littérature italienne[3].\n\nSous une forme ou une autre, le Turandot de Gozzi occupe Busoni à divers moments entre 1904 et 1917. Il aime beaucoup les contes fantastiques et magiques : son œuvre précédente est le Concerto pour piano (en), op. 39, BV247, qui comprend de la musique d'une adaptation inachevée de l'Aladdin d'Oehlenschlager[4].\n\nEn 1904, Busoni commence à ébaucher de la musique de scène pour la fable chinoise de Gozzi. Il arrange aussi une suite, qu'il interprète la première fois en 1905 et publie en 1906. La pièce de Gozzi est montée avec la musique de Busoni par Max Reinhardt à Berlin en 1911, et à Londres en 1913[5].\n\nAprès le déclenchement de la Première Guerre mondiale, Busoni, étant Italien, trouve de plus en plus difficile de rester à Berlin et finit par déménager à Zurich, où il n'a pas à prendre parti. De la fin de 1915 au mois d' , il est occupé à écrire son opéra en un acte, Arlecchino, mais le Stadttheater de Zurich ne veut pas monter une production sans pièce d'accompagnement. Il écrit rapidement un livret en allemand inspiré de la pièce de Gozzi et adapte sa suite Turandot en court opéra en deux actes avec dialogues parlés[6]. Le , Busoni écrit à Egon Petri :\n\n« La question importante de savoir quelle pièce je devrais combiner avec l'opéra Arlecchino d'une durée d'une heure pour remplir une soirée, mes ennuis qui en ont résulté et le désir d'établir un programme durablement valable m'ont amené à décider hâtivement de composer un opéra en deux actes à partir de la matière et du fond de Turandot. Depuis quelques semaines, j'ai travaillé dur à cette tâche délicieuse, écrivant le livret et la musique d'un opéra sur Turandot. Je récris le texte entièrement et indépendamment pour en rapprocher le ton de celui d'une pantomime ou d'une pièce de théâtre. C'est un travail plus ardu que je ne me l'imaginais, mais je me sens inspiré. Les personnages masqués communs aux deux œuvres servent à les lier (sinon, ils tranchent complètement les uns sur les autres)[7]. »\n\nBusoni termine l'opéra Turandot en vitesse (300 pages en 100 jours) à la fin de 1916 et en dirige la première avec Arlecchino à Zurich en 1917. Dent mentionne que Busoni était satisfait de son travail[6].\n\nLe livret de Busoni comprend diverses bizarreries qui rappellent qu'il provient de la commedia dell'arte : des personnages portent des noms italiens tels que Truffaldino et Pantalone, Allah est loué en Chine, et il y a des mentions de Venise, de la basilique Saint-Marc et de gondoles. Le dialogue parlé remonte aux opéras de Mozart, notamment à La Flûte enchantée[8]. En comparaison du Turandot un peu épiquement boursouflé de Puccini, l'œuvre de Busoni l'esthète conserve l'atmosphère irréel, intime, de la pièce de Gozzi[9]. La princesse Turandot de Busoni n'est pas aussi implacable ; son cœur est plus prêt à fondre.\n\nBusoni réutilisa une partie du matériel qu'il avait composé pour l'opéra : il révisa à nouveau la suite orchestrale Turandot en 1917 en remplaçant la marche funèbre du dernier mouvement par l'Avertissement d'Altoum (BV 248b[5]) et il publia séparément Altoums Gebet de l'acte 2 (écrit pour l'opéra) sous forme de la Prière d'Altoum pour baryton et petit orchestre, op. 49 1, BV 277.\n\nLa première de Turandot de Busoni a lieu avec celle de son Arlecchino le au Stadttheater de Zurich. Le producteur est Hans Rogorsch, et le décorateur, Albert Isler[10]. Turandot et Arlecchino ont leur première en Allemagne le à l'opéra de Francfort sous la direction de Gustav Brecher[11], et sont repris le à l'opéra de Cologne sous la direction d'Otto Klemperer, qui vient d'y être nommé premier chef[12]. Les deux opéras sont interprétés à l'opéra de Berlin le sous la direction ferme du chef d'orchestre wagnérien Leo Blech (en) et y connaissent un grand succès[13].\n\nLa première interprétation de Turandot en Italie (sans Arlecchino) a lieu le à Rome sous la direction de Fernando Previtali. Chantre de Busoni, Previtali, continue de diriger l'œuvre dans d'autres villes italiennes avant d'en diriger la première au théâtre Colón de Buenos Aires en 1964.\n\nLa première en Angleterre a lieu à Londres le dans une traduction anglaise de Lionel Salter. Elle est radiodiffusée à l'émission BBC Third Programme de la BBC.\n\nLa première américaine a lieu sous forme d'opéra concert au Philharmonic Hall de New York le . Elle est suivie d'une version mise partiellement en scène à la First Presbyterian Church de Berkeley le sous la direction de Kent Nagano, âgé de 28 ans. Une interprétation de l'œuvre avec mise en scène complète est donnée le par le Connecticut Grand Opera (en) à Stamford. Gregory Stapp (en) y joue l'empereur Altoum ; Juan Luque Carmona, Kalaf ; et Patricia Craig (en), le rôle-titre[11].\n\nTrois flûtes (la troisième doublant le piccolo), trois hautbois (le troisième doublant le cor anglais), trois clarinettes (la troisième doublant une clarinette basse), trois bassons (le troisième doublant le contrebasson), quatre cors d'harmonie, quatre trompettes, trois trombones, un tuba ; percussion (timbales, glockenspiel, triangle, tambourin, covered drum⇔tambour voilé, grosse caisse, gong) ; deux harpes ; solistes, chœur ; cordes[5],[14],[15].\n\nBusoni simplifia beaucoup la pièce en cinq actes de Gozzi pour en faire un opéra en deux actes composés de deux scènes chacun[16]. L'intrigue de base reste toutefois la même. Turandot, fille de l'empereur, défie tous ceux qui désirent l'épouser de résoudre trois énigmes. Elle épousera celui qui y parviendra, mais ceux qui échoueront seront exécutés. Kalaf, prince déguisé en exil, relève le défi.\n\nKalaf tombe sur l'image abandonnée par un prétendant exécuté et décide d'obtenir la main de Turandot.\n\nL'empereur Altoum se plaint de l'intransigeance de Turandot. Kalaf dit qu'il préfère mourir s'il échoue. Turandot entre avec sa servante Adelma, qui reconnaît le prétendant mais garde le silence. Kalaf répond bien aux trois énigmes et défie Turandot de découvrir son nom et ses origines ; si elle réussit, il partira.\n\nLes jeunes filles esclaves dansent sur une version chorale sans mot de Greensleeves[17]. Turandot avoue les sentiments mitigés qu'elle éprouve envers le prince. Adelma lui dit qu'elle connaît le nom de ce dernier et qu'elle le lui révélera en échange de sa liberté ; Turandot accepte.\n\nTurandot révèle le nom du prince en répandant la consternation, et Kalaf s'apprête à partir, mais Turandot l'arrête en lui disant qu'il a éveillé son cœur. L'œuvre se termine par l'ensemble Was ist das alle Menschen bindet? (qu'est-ce qui gouverne tous les hommes ?), question à laquelle la réponse est : Die Liebe (l'amour).\n• Arlecchino et Turandot - Chœur et orchestre de l'Opéra de Lyon 18\n• Turandot - Orchestre symphonique de la radio de Berlin 19\n• Cet article est partiellement ou en totalité issu de l’article de Wikipédia en anglais intitulé .\n• None William et Harold , Puccini's Turandot : The End of the Great Tradition , Princeton, , 193 (ISBN , .\n• None Kii-Ming , Ping, Pong, Pang.

Though reputed to be staunchly dedicated to the worship of the Old Norse gods, they would allegedly fight for any lord who could pay their substantial fees, even if he were Christian. The institution of the Jomsvikings would itself foreshadow those of the later religious and chivalric orders of the Middle Ages.[1]\n\nThe legend of the Jomsvikings appears in some of the Icelandic sagas from the 12th and 13th centuries. According to the sagas (particularly the Jómsvíkinga saga, King Olaf Tryggvasson’s Saga, and stories found in the Flatey Book), their stronghold of Jomsborg was located on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, but its exact location has been disputed by modern historians and archeologists. Jomsborg is also thought by some researchers to be identical with Jumne, Julin and Vineta, which are mentioned in both Danish and German records from the Middle Ages.[2][3][4][5] There is no medieval source that mentions a precise location of Jomsborg except for the disputed Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum (at 53°51′50″N 14°43′05″E﻿ / ﻿53.86389°N 14.71806°E﻿ / 53.86389; 14.71806) that was alleged to have been discovered in the autumn of 2019.[6][7][8]\n\nHistorians still debate the accuracy of the accounts of the Jomsvikings. Without a conclusively identified location for their headquarters, and because of a lack of primary or contemporary sources specifically mentioning the Jomsvikings or Jomsborg, confirming the tales of their exploits has been difficult. However, there are three contemporary runestones, as well as passages in Old Norse poetry and the lausavísur, that refer to their battles.[9]\n\nThe Saga of the Jomsvikings relates that the Jomsvikings were highly selective in deciding whom to admit to their order. Membership was restricted to men of proven valor between 18 and 50 (with the exception of a boy named Vagn Åkesson, who defeated Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson in single combat at the age of 12). In order to gain admission, prospective members were required to prove themselves with a feat of strength, which often took the form of a ritual duel, or holmgang, with a Jomsviking.\n\nOnce admitted, the Jomsvikings required adherence to a strict code of conduct to instill a sense of military discipline among its members. Any violation of the rules could be punished with immediate expulsion from the order. Each Jomsviking was bound to defend his brothers and to avenge their deaths if necessary. He was forbidden to speak ill of his fellows or to quarrel with them. Blood feuds between members were to be mediated by Jomsviking officers. Jomsvikings were forbidden to show fear or to flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength, but orderly retreat in the face of vastly-outnumbering forces appears to have been acceptable. All spoils of battle were to be equally distributed among the entire brotherhood. No Jomsviking was permitted to be absent from Jomsborg for more than three days without the permission of the brotherhood. No women or children were allowed within the fortress walls, and none was to be taken captive. It is unclear, however, whether members were forbidden marriage or liaisons with women outside the walls.\n\nThere are different accounts for the origins of the order. Gesta Danorum (book 10) tells that a settlement named Julinum was conquered by the King of Denmark, Harald Bluetooth, who gave it to the Swedish prince Styrbjörn the Strong. Harald then provided Styrbjörn with a strong force with which Styrbjörn terrorized the seas. The Knýtlinga saga agrees by giving Harald as the founder of the Jomsvikings, but the story of Styrbjörn is not connected to the Jomsvikings. The Jómsvíkinga saga says that the settlement was founded by Palnatoke, receiving the location from the mythical Wendish ruler Burislav. Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa and Eyrbyggja saga agree with all previously mentioned versions by making Styrbjörn take command of the Jomsvikings after they already had been established.[10] Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa also tells that among the Norse there were many men from the \"East land\" arriving at Jomsborg, suggesting that it was a settlement of mixed ethnicity. Jomsviking chieftains included Palnatok, Styrbjörn the Strong, Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson, Thorkell the High, and Hemeng.[citation needed]\n\nAccounts of their size vary. In various sources, Jomsborg was supposed to have held anywhere from 30 to 300 ships in its harbor. However some historians believe Jomsborg was largely a market center with its Danish garrison imposed on the Wends.[11]\n\nGesta Danorum (book 10), Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa and Eyrbyggja saga relate that in the early 980s, the exiled Swedish prince Styrbjörn the Strong brought the Jomsvikings to a devastating defeat against Styrbjörn's uncle King Eric the Victorious at the Battle of the Fýrisvellir, Uppsala, in 984 or 985, while trying to take the crown of Sweden by force of arms.[10] The fact that the Jomsvikings lost was attributed to a pact which the Swedish king Eric made with Odin. Three runestones from this time, the Högby Runestone (\"the brave champion Asmund fell on the Fyrisvellir\"), one of the Hällestad Runestones, labelled DR 295 (\"he did not flee at Uppsala\"), and the Sjörup Runestone (\"He did not flee at Uppsala, but slaughtered as long as he had a weapon\"), relate to deaths with honour at Uppsala, probably three Jomsvikings. The battle is also commemorated, in poetry, by the Icelandic skald Þórvaldr Hjaltason, who took part in the battle on the Swedish side.[citation needed] Jómsvíkinga saga tells that in 986, they attacked Haakon Jarl in Norway and were defeated in the Battle of Hjörungavágr. The saga recounts that Jomsvikings captured by the Norwegians and about to be executed exhibited courage and defiance, some being eventually spared by their captors. The Jómsvíkinga saga ends with a brief explanation of the battle's aftermath and, in fact, points to this battle as the beginning of the end for the Jomsvikings.[citation needed]\n\nAfter these two decisive defeats, the power of the Jomsvikings waned, but Olaf Trygvasson's Saga relates that they played a decisive, if treacherous, role in the Battle of Svolder in 1000. At Svolder, a Jomsviking force led by Sigvald Jarl abandoned King Olaf of Norway and joined forces with his enemies to annihilate his fleet.[citation needed] This action may have been intended to fight the Christianization of Scandinavia, which had been forcibly promoted by Olaf. As it happened though, the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard, who won the Norwegian throne when the sea battle ended, was (at least nominally) a Christian. He and his father, King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, are reported to have been baptized in 965.[12] Their decline continued over the next few decades.\n\nAccording to the Heimskringla, King Magnus I of Norway decided to put an end to the Jomsviking threat. As part of consolidating his control of Denmark, he sacked Jomsborg in 1043, destroying the fortress and killing many of its inhabitants.[13]\n\nA golden disc bearing the name of Harald Bluetooth and Jomsvikings stronghold seat Jomsborg was re-discovered in Sweden in autumn 2014. The disc, also called the Curmsun Disc, is made of high gold content and has a weight of 25.23 grams. On the obverse there is a Latin inscription and on the reverse there is a Latin cross with four dots surrounded by an octagonal ridge. The inscription reads: \"+ARALD CVRMSVN+REX AD TANER+SCON+JVMN+CIV ALDIN+\" and translates as \"Harald Gormsson king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, diocese of Aldinburg\".[14] It is assumed that the disc was a part of a Viking hoard found in 1841 in the Polish village Wiejkowo near the town of Wolin by Heinrich Boldt.[15][16]\n• Jomsvikings are the focus of E. R. Eddison's novel Styrbiorn the Strong 17 and Horned Helmet 18 a juvenile historical novel by Henry Treece.\n• Fictionalized versions of the Jomsborg (under the name \"Jormsvik\") and the Jomsvikings appear in Guy Gavriel Kay's novel The Last Light of the Sun, which is set in a fictional world that closely parallels 9th-century Britain and Scandinavia. 19\n• In Tim Severin's Viking series, Thorgils spends time amongst the Jomsvikings, although they are a smaller, older, and weaker force.\n• The Long Ships by Frans G. Bengtsson retells an episode from the sagas, where a band of defeated Jomsvikings, about to be executed in Norway, are proud, undaunted and defiant to the end - winning their captors' grudging respect and some of them surviving against all odds.\n• The short story The King of Norway by Cecelia Holland, in the anthology Warriors, has at its center the story of the Battle of Hjörungavágr. 20\n• In the manga Vinland Saga by Makoto Yukimura, several of the main characters are based on Jomsvikings from the Sagas, such as Thorkell the High and Canute the Great. The manga depicts them as an elite force under Sven and then Canute during their invasion of England, while trying to keep their waning influence on the court. It is also said that the protagonist Thorfinn's father, Thors, was a Jomsviking until he became a pacifist, fleeing Jomsborg with his wife.\n• In the 2003 Polish film An Ancient Tale: When the Sun Was a God by Jerzy Hoffman, Jomsvikings are portrayed as marauders in the service of the main antagonist Popiel.\n• Swedish melodic death metal band Amon Amarth released the album Jomsviking in 2016.

But what do you guys think?Religión - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Religión suele definirse como un sistema cultural de determinados comportamientos, prácticas, cosmovisiones, éticas, morales, textos, lugares sagrados, profecías u organizaciones que relacionan la humanidad a elementos sobrenaturales, trascendentales, místicos o espirituales.[nota 1]​ Aunque no existe un consenso académico sobre qué constituye exactamente una religión,[1]​[2]​[3]​ Bernard Lonergan se aproxima a la religión como un conjunto de experiencias, significados, convicciones, creencias y expresiones de un grupo, a través de las cuales sus participantes responden a sus dialécticas de autotrascendencia y relación con la divinidad.[4]​\n\nMuchas religiones pueden haber organizado comportamientos, clero, una definición de lo que constituye la adhesión o pertenencia, lugares santos y escrituras.\n\nLa práctica de una religión puede incluir rituales, sermones, conmemoración o veneración (a una deidad, dioses o diosas), sacrificios, peregrinaciones, procesiones, festivales, festines, trance, iniciaciones, oficios funerarios, oficios matrimoniales, meditación, oración, música, arte, danza, servicio comunitario u otros aspectos de la cultura humana.[5]​\n\nMuchas religiones tienen narrativas, símbolos e historias sagradas que pretenden explicar el sentido de la vida o explicar el origen de la vida o el universo. A partir de estas creencias sobre el cosmos y la naturaleza humana, las personas pueden derivar una moral, ética o leyes religiosas o un estilo de vida.\n\nEn promedio, las mujeres de algunos países como Estados Unidos reportan ser «más religiosas» que los hombres.[6]​ No obstante, estudios al respecto no han observado esta tendencia fuera del ámbito de la religión cristiana.[7]​[8]​ Algunas personas siguen múltiples religiones o varios principios religiosos al mismo tiempo, independientemente de si la tradición de los principios religiosos que siguen permite el sincretismo o no.[9]​[10]​[11]​\n\nLa etimología del término «religión» ha sido debatida durante siglos debido a las dos interpretaciones que se han sostenido que además de ofrecer una propuesta acerca del origen de la palabra, subrayan alguna actitud religiosa.\n\nAntes de ser usada con un sentido relacionado con las divinidades, el término «religión» o «religioso» era utilizado para expresar un temor o un escrúpulo supersticioso. Así consta en textos de Julio César (De Bello Gallico VI 36) y Tito Livio (Historia de Roma desde su fundación IV 30).\n\nLa primera interpretación relacionada con el culto es la del orador latino Cicerón que en su obra De natura deorum ofrece la siguiente etimología: «Quienes se interesan en todas las cosas relacionadas con el culto, las retoman atentamente y como que las releen, son llamados «religiosos» a partir de la relectura».[12]​ Esta etimología —filológicamente más correcta— subraya la fidelidad a los deberes que la persona religiosa contrae con la divinidad y por tanto está más relacionada con la justicia.[13]​\n\nLa otra etimología propuesta por Lactancio hace derivar la palabra «religión» del verbo latino religare: «atados,ligados por un vínculo de piedad a Dios estamos “religados”, de donde el mismo término “religión” tiene su origen, no —como fue propuesto por Cicerón— a partir de “releyendo”».[14]​ Este segundo sentido resalta la relación de dependencia que «religa» al hombre con las potencias superiores de las cuales él se puede llegar a sentir dependiente y que le lleva a tributarles actos de culto.[15]​\n\nEn su ensayo Del imperio romano, José Ortega y Gasset escribe «Cuando el hombre cree en algo, cuando algo le es incuestionable realidad, se hace religioso de ello. Religio no viene, como suele decirse, de religare, de estar atado el hombre a Dios. Como tantas veces, es el adjetivo quien nos conserva la significación original del sustantivo, y religiosus quería decir ‘escrupuloso’; por tanto, el que no se comporta a la ligera, sino cuidadosamente. Lo contrario de religión es negligencia, descuido, desentenderse, abandonarse. Frente a relego está nec-lego; religente (religiosus)[16]​ se opone a negligente».[17]​\n\nDesde el establecimiento del concepto, definir qué es religión (del latín religare o re-legere) ha sido y es motivo de controversia entre especialistas y practicantes. Por ejemplo, según el sociólogo G. Lenski, es «un sistema compartido de creencias y prácticas asociadas, que se articulan en torno a la naturaleza de las fuerzas que configuran el destino de los seres humanos».[18]​ Por su parte, el antropólogo Clifford Geertz propone una definición alternativa: «La religión es un sistema de símbolos que obra para establecer vigorosos, penetrantes y duraderos estados anímicos y motivaciones en los hombres, formulando concepciones de un orden general de existencia y revistiendo estas concepciones con una aureola de efectividad tal que los estados anímicos y motivaciones parezcan de un realismo único».[19]​\n\nDebido al amplio uso del término, resulta especialmente complejo ofrecer una definición exhaustiva de la religión o del fenómeno religioso. Sin embargo, se puede afirmar que como hecho antropológico engloba, entre otros, los siguientes elementos: tradiciones, culturas ancestrales, instituciones, escrituras, historia, mitología, fe y credos, experiencias personales, interpersonales, místicas, ritos, liturgias, oraciones y otras. Para un estudio detallado es útil señalar que la religión es uno de los objetos de estudio centrales de la teología y en ello Bernard Lonergan señala ocho especializaciones funcionales constitutivas que generan un marco amplio de análisis: 1) la investigación de datos, 2) la interpretación, 3) la historia, 4) la dialéctica, 5) la explicitación de fundamentos, 6) el establecimiento de doctrinas, 7) la sistematización y 8) la comunicación.[20]​ Por ejemplo, el debate religioso ganará efectividad al centrarse en un tema puntual, como interpretar críticamente el mismo texto o comparar fundamentos interreligiosos, pero difícilmente avanzará al mezclar los ocho elementos sin método alguno.\n\nMás aún, las contradicciones son a veces solo aparentes. Uno de los elementos de debate puede rastrearse al observar que la palabra «religión» en ocasiones se usa como sinónimo de «religión organizada», «organización religiosa», o \"jerarquía religiosa\" es decir, grupos de personas que respaldan el ejercicio o la actividad de ciertas creencias y ceremonias, frecuentemente bajo la forma de entidades legales. Es decir, el debate puede explicarse del siguiente modo: mientras los teístas suelen argumentar sobre los méritos de la autotrascendencia humana o la naturaleza de la divinidad, los no-teístas critican los efectos nocivos de una jerarquía religiosa que favorece la decadencia de un colectivo. Bajo una óptica dialéctica, es razonable notar elementos de razón en ambos argumentos.\n\nPara elaborar sobre el origen del debate anterior, es útil seguir el análisis de especialización funcional, estratificación y jerarquía propuesto por Niklas Luhmann, donde las diversas actividades al interior de los colectivos ganan naturalmente detalle, prioridad y subordinación conforme los grupos se desarrollan.[21]​ Así, diversas experiencias, significados, convicciones y expresiones son atendidas primero los individuos más capaces, para después generar roles religiosos y eventualmente jerarquías entre individuos. Puede así entenderse que con tiempo las jerarquías religiosas suelen subordinar el interés colectivo al propio, auto afirmar su autoridad y establecer marcos normativos que les beneficien, consolidando la clausura operativa de un grupo, descrita también por Luhmann. Sin embargo ese mismo hecho, activa la imposibilidad futura del acoplamiento estructural del sistema religioso con su entorno, iniciando un proceso de decadencia.\n\nEs decir, el método de otras ciencias enriquece el debate religioso. Diversas ciencias humanas se han interesado por el fenómeno religioso desde sus respectivos puntos de vista como por ejemplo la antropología, la sociología, la psicología y la historia de las religiones. Por otro lado, disciplinas como la fenomenología de la religión estudian específicamente sus manifestaciones intentando dar con una definición exhaustiva del fenómeno y mostrar su relación con la índole propia del ser humano. En secciones subsecuentes se desarrollan más elementos para el análisis de la religión.\n\nFilosóficamente, la religión puede ser un estilo de vida, un camino hacia la plenitud, una plenitud que inicia desde el mismo instante que se cobra conciencia de la misma.\n\nEn un sentido más amplio, también se utiliza para referirse a una obligación de conciencia que impele al cumplimiento de un deber.[22]​\n\nLa definición del amplio espectro de significados que refleja el concepto religión, en cuanto implica encontrar un elemento propio, distintivo y único, es una exigencia propia de las culturas occidentales,[23]​ ya que son estas las que desde una postura más teísta distinguen entre divinidad y el resto del mundo. Especialmente, desde la Ilustración se han elaborado muchas y variadas definiciones intentando recoger los aspectos propios del fenómeno religioso. Aquí se mencionarán los más significativos. Es obvio que las definiciones que parten de un Ser Supremo o lo dan por supuesto se han de rechazar, pues no se aplican a muchas religiones de Asia oriental o a los pueblos primitivos.\n\nUna posibilidad es intentar una definición desde el punto de vista de las personas que practican la religión. Así encontramos propuestas como las de Friedrich Schleiermacher: «sentimiento de dependencia absoluta» que luego distingue este sentimiento de los tipos de dependencia relativa. William James subraya más bien «el carácter entusiasta de la adhesión» de los miembros de las religiones. Desde este punto de vista se pueden considerar elementos como los sentimientos, los factores experienciales, emotivos o intuitivos, pero siempre desde una perspectiva más bien individualista.\n\nCon el estudio que las ciencias humanas (sociología y antropología cultural especialmente) han realizado de la religión, se ha logrado formular otro conjunto de definiciones que consideran este fenómeno en su ámbito social y cultural. La conocida definición del sociólogo francés Durkheim entra en este grupo: «Una religión es un sistema solidario de creencias y de prácticas relativas a las cosas sagradas. […] Toda sociedad posee todo lo necesario para suscitar en sus miembros la sensación de lo divino, simplemente a través del poder que ella ejerce sobre ellos».[24]​\n\nSin embargo, con la llegada de la fenomenología de la religión se intentó ir más allá de las formas que buscaban el núcleo propio del fenómeno en la sociedad o en los aspectos individuales. Y en ese ámbito se identificó como propio de la religión el hecho de la presencia o consciencia de lo sagrado. Rudolf Otto en su obra, Lo santo, publicada en 1917, indica como esencia de la consciencia religiosa el temor reverencial ante aquello que, siendo desconocido (mysterium), al mismo tiempo sobrecoge (tremendum) y atrae casi irresistiblemente (fascinans).[25]​\n\nSin embargo, estos elementos que Otto refiere como propios de la experiencia religiosa parecen estar ausentes en las religiones asiáticas. En Mircea Eliade se da una ampliación de la noción de «sagrado» que perfecciona la definición de Otto. Habla de espacios, cosas y tiempos sagrados en la medida en que estos se relacionan con simbolismos y rituales propios de las religiones. Así la religión es la configuración u organización de la existencia a partir de dimensiones profundas de la experiencia humana que relacionan al hombre con algo que se le presenta como último y trascendente. Tales dimensiones varían de acuerdo con las circunstancias y culturas.\n\nA partir del siglo XVIII, con la irrupción del humanismo y el movimiento de los ilustrados en Europa, que se extenderá con rapidez a otras partes del mundo, se intenta separar la doctrina del Estado de la doctrina religiosa. Actualmente, estas ideas de separación de los poderes político y religioso todavía no ha concluido. En buena parte del planeta apenas ha empezado, y en los países occidentales, aunque observan la laicidad del Estado, todavía la religión puede actuar con una enorme influencia en sus legislaciones. Por ejemplo, en el caso de Estados Unidos,[26]​ Polonia o Italia.\n\nEn los países asiáticos, la separación entre Estado y religión está más o menos implícita de cierto laicismo. China, Japón, Vietnam y otros países del sudeste asiático conllevan cierto laicismo estatal en su propia historia al ser países en donde coexisten distintas religiones. En el caso de Tailandia o Sri Lanka, con mayorías budistas en más de un 90 %, se mantienen debates sociales para afrontar el laicismo del Estado y diversos cambios legales.[27]​\n\nEn los países con mayorías musulmanas hay distintas aproximaciones a la laicidad del Estado. Países como Turquía o Siria son más laicos, mientras que otros como Irán o Arabia Saudí se definen como islámicos. El mundo islámico es variado y complejo, y existen movimientos tanto secularizadores como prorreligiosos.[28]​\n\nIsrael es un Estado laico, si bien se proyecta como religioso. India es un caso parecido, también es un país laico, aunque su organización social y legislación están muy influidas por la religión. En estos casos están influidos, en buena medida, por el componente étnico de sus religiones mayoritarias.\n\nExisten diferentes clasificaciones de las religiones, según el criterio que se elija, por ejemplo:\n• Teísmo: es la creencia en una o más deidades. Dentro del teísmo cabe distinguir entre:\n• Monoteístas: aquellas religiones que afirman la existencia de un solo dios, que a menudo es el creador del universo. Las religiones monoteístas más numerosas son el cristianismo, islam y sijismo; seguidas por el judaísmo, bahaísmo noajísmo y el zoroastrismo 29 ​ 30 ​ 31 ​ 32 ​\n• Politeístas: creen en la existencia de diversos dioses organizados en una jerarquía o panteón, como ocurre en el hinduismo, el shinto japonés, o las antiguas religiones de la humanidad como la griega, la romana o la egipcia. Pueden ser incluidas creencias a veces calificadas como animistas como el vudú del oeste de África, que contempla espíritus existentes en los elementos de la naturaleza pero también diversas deidades. También cabe incluir aquí la mayoría de corrientes del neopaganismo moderno.\n• Henoteístas: el orientalista alemán Max Müller acuñó este término en el siglo para referirse a la creencia en un solo dios en la que se admiten otras deidades, como sucedía en la antigua religión egipcia especialmente con Akenatón. Aunque ya en la época de Muller resultó un término problemático, 33 ​ quedó con el tiempo incluido académicante dentro de politeísmo, panteísmo, etc., dependiendo del caso histórico. Actualmente, algunas sectas y cultos neopaganos han resucitado el término 34 ​\n• Dualistas: aquellas religiones que suponen la existencia de dos principios o divinidades opuestos y enfrentados entre sí, aunque solo uno de ellos suele ser merecedor de veneración por sus fieles, mientras que el otro es considerado demoníaco o destructivo. Cabe incluir en esta categoría el maniqueísmo y el catarismo.\n• No teístas: Hay religiones como el budismo y el taoísmo que no aceptan o no reconocen la existencia de dioses absolutos o creadores universales, o bien les otorgan funciones menores o muy específicas (como, por ejemplo, la creencia taoísta en el emperador de Jade). En ocasiones, estas deidades son vistas como recursos metafóricos utilizados para referirse a fenómenos naturales o a estados de la mente.\n• Panteísmo: es la creencia de que el universo, la naturaleza y Dios son equivalentes.\n• Panenteísmo: es la creencia de que Dios es a la vez inmanente y trascendente al universo o, en otras palabras, que Dios engloba el universo pero no se limita a él.\n\nOtra división que se utiliza consiste en hablar de religiones reveladas o no reveladas.\n• Las religiones reveladas se fundamentan en una verdad revelada de carácter sobrenatural desde una deidad o ámbito trascendente y que indica a menudo cuáles son los dogmas en los que se debe creer y las normas y ritos que se deben seguir.\n• Las religiones no reveladas no definen su origen según un mensaje dado por deidades o mensajeros de ellas, aunque pueden contener sistemas elaborados de organización de deidades reconociendo la existencia de estas deidades y espíritus en las manifestaciones de la naturaleza.\n\nOtra clasificación de las religiones es por origen o familia. Las religiones se agrupan en troncos de donde derivan, por ejemplo:\n\nUsualmente se acepta que las principales familias de religiones son las siguientes:\n\nAlgunas religiones de reciente creación tienen un estatus complejo, ya que no son reconocidas como religiones de manera universal. Según la antropología y la sociología, una secta o nuevo movimiento religioso es un grupo de personas con afinidades comunes: culturales, religiosas, políticas, esotéricas, etc. Habitualmente es un término peyorativo, frente al cual ha surgido el eufemismo «nuevos movimientos religiosos».\n\nAunque el vocablo «secta» esté relacionado con grupos que posean una misma afinidad, con el paso de los años ha adquirido una connotación relacionada con grupos de carácter religioso, a los que se califica como «secta destructiva». Estos grupos pueden tener un historial judicial en uno o varios países, por manipulación mental o por ser grupos de carácter destructivo. En algunos países, algunas de estas no están reconocidas o autorizadas. A menudo una secta está centrada en el culto personal al profeta o líder del grupo. La palabra secta se ha concebido derivada, principalmente, del latín sequi, ‘seguir’.\n\nLista de las principales religiones actualmente practicadas en el mundo, por orden alfabético.\n• Bahaísmo: fundado por Bahá'u'lláh (1817-1892), considerado por sus creyentes como el prometido de todas las religiones.

Sus enseñanzas se basan en el profeta y poeta Zoroastro del antiguo Imperio persa.\n• Deísmo: es una corriente de la filosofía que admite, mediante el raciocinio y la experiencia, la existencia de Dios como creador del mundo natural. La doctrina, sin embargo, no acepta otros elementos característicos de las religiones en su relación con la divinidad, como la existencia de revelaciones o la práctica de cultos. Puede decirse, por lo tanto, que los deístas creen en Dios pero no en las prácticas y los dogmas religiosos. El deísmo reconoce que Dios ha creado el universo aunque no cree en su intervención posterior para orquestar su destino.\n• Agnosticismo: la creencia de que la mayoría de las cosas son incognoscibles. En lo que respecta a la religión, generalmente se caracteriza por no creer ni no creer en una deidad.\n• Ateísmo: la creencia de que no existen deidades de ningún tipo.\n\nEl estudio de la religión suele implicar numerosos campos de investigación, entre ellos:\n• La religión comparada se ocupa del estudio comparativo de ideas, prácticas y demás elementos de las religiones.\n• La teología: trata de la cuestión de Dios y de sus relaciones con el mundo, y puede estudiarse separada de cualquier religión determinada o bien referida a una de ellas en particular.\n• La organología: en una religión en particular, trata de sus elementos, sus prácticas, su organización y su orden institucional.[cita requerida]\n• La apologética se interesa en la defensa de una religión particular, contra posibles ataques o críticas.\n• La psicología de la religión trata sobre los factores de la conducta humana, su mente y sus operaciones, tal como se manifiestan en la conducta religiosa. La psicología de la religión explica por qué un pueblo determinado prohija determinadas ideas religiosas, mediante el estudio de sus necesidades naturales, su ambiente y sus inclinaciones.\n• La neuroteología estudia la correlación entre los fenómenos neuronales con las experiencias subjetivas de carácter espiritual.\n• La filosofía de la religión la filosofía se ha ocupado de la religión en incontables ocasiones por su interés en el estudio de lo trascendente y su naturaleza así como su papel en la vida humana. En la segunda mitad del siglo pasado ha sido especialmente fructífera en cuanto a la religión por sus aportaciones en lógica y epistemología. Se ha explorado filosóficamente la experiencia religiosa, la fe y el discurso de las religiones 39 ​\n• La historia de la religión: trata de descubrir la base cultural de las ideas y prácticas de una religión concreta. Historiadores son también los estudiosos de los libros sagrados de las religiones, unos ejercen la llamada «alta crítica», estudiando los manuscritos para comprobar la validez de sus reivindicaciones; otros se ocupan de la llamada «crítica fundamental» o «crítica textual» dedicándose a la búsqueda y examen de textos auténticos. Podrían citarse muchos campos de especialización: estudios de las empresas misioneras, evolución de las instituciones religiosas (historia de la iglesia, inquisición...), manifestaciones de arte (música sacra, arquitectura religiosa, etc), religiones primitivas, sociología de la religión y orígenes sociales.\n• La religión apocalíptica: trata de estudiar los libros sagrados de las diferentes religiones, y encontrar su \"apocalipsis\" para estudiarlo, analizarlo, y encontrar los \"secretos de Dios\" para descubrirlos y encontrar el significado de los libros sagrados y su fin del mundo.\n\nA lo largo de la Historia, la práctica de la religión se ha organizado de diferentes maneras en sociedad. El hombre primitivo depositaba en el chamán (curandero) el conocimiento y explicaciones sobre asuntos religiosos. Esta figura todavía existe en pueblos indígenas de América, África y Oceanía.\n\nLas primeras civilizaciones agrícolas, con el desarrollo de las ciudades, verán surgir la figura del sacerdote, que se erige como mediador entre la sociedad y las divinidades. Esta figura cobrará una importancia enorme en Egipto, Grecia, Roma y América precolombina. A menudo con una doble función de médico y guía espiritual, supone una evolución del antiguo guía-chamán de la tribus primitivas.\n\nEl monacato surge en religiones como el cristianismo, el budismo o el taoísmo. El monacato allí donde está presente, personifica un esfuerzo más intenso en un camino religioso, y supondrá el esfuerzo por reunir o proteger a los eremitas dispersos. En religiones como la hebrea o el islamismo, son las personas con una notable capacidad de interpretación de las escrituras sagradas las que ostentan el papel de guía de una comunidad de seguidores. Así, la figura del imán o del rabino están presentes en estas religiones.\n\nEn el entorno hinduista, la casta de los brahmanes es la encargada de aclarar los asuntos religiosos.\n\nEn la Grecia Antigua, los filósofos ya intentaban explicar el origen de las creencias. Critias (filósofo y militar espartano, discípulo de Sócrates) pensaba que la religión (y el temor a los dioses) se determinó para imponer a cada uno el respeto a la sociedad: disciplina, moral, sentido del bien y del mal. Lucrecio en De rerum natura, emite la hipótesis de que los hombres inventaron a los dioses para explicar las maravillas y los misterios de la naturaleza: para explicar lo que no controlaban. Los antropólogos, psicólogos y sociólogos mantienen para la mayoría estas dos explicaciones.\n\nHasta el siglo XX, la perspectiva dominante sobre el origen de la experiencia religiosa la sitúa en el sentimiento de espanto o miedo ante lo desconocido o aquello que escapa a una explicación racional. Este punto de vista se hizo famoso por los trabajos de Rudolf Otto.[40]​ Más tarde, Mircea Eliade propone el término de hierofanía como percepción de lo sagrado, en donde el impulso o sentimiento religioso está caracterizado por un sentimiento de insuficiencia ante la explicación de la realidad que ofrecen los sentidos y la razón humanas.[41]​ La idea de hierofanía que propone Eliade asienta una oposición entre lo sagrado y lo profano que desplaza la anterior entre razón y miedo irracional. Este enfoque será el germen de un nuevo tratamiento en los estudios sobre la religión, y posibilitará su expansión en las principales universidades de Europa[42]​\n\nEn las religiones más antiguas, algunos miembros de sociedades de cazadores-recolectores o agrícolas se aislaban, en un estado de privación sensorial para favorecer la aparición de visiones y sueños místicos.[43]​ A menudo diversos métodos o productos alucinógenos eran empleados, como activadores de estos procesos. Estas prácticas todavía existen en las diversas formas del chamanismo. Del mismo modo, inciensos y plantas especiales como el opio y el cornezuelo del centeno, con propiedades alucinógenas, se desarrollaron en los oráculos de Grecia, Egipto y Roma. Esta utilización de sustancias externas podemos encontrarla en la historia en el origen de muchas de las grandes religiones; como por ejemplo ocurre con los primeros desarrollos visionarios de los pueblos indoeuropeos hace más de 10.000 años,[44]​ y que posteriormente se asentarían en el valle del Indo hace más de 4000 años.\n\nEn su evolución histórica, algunas religiones se irán sofisticando para observar nociones de pureza de cuerpo y espíritu que irán desterrando la alteración de la psique mediante sustancias externas. Las sustituirán los rituales, oraciones, y técnicas contemplativas que se convertirán en los facilitadores de la experiencia religiosa. Esta evolución, unida al triunfo o colapso de las diferentes civilizaciones que las acogen, y a la presión del medio social en el que se desenvuelven, explicarán en buena medida el futuro de las distintas religiones.\n\nLa actitud de los primeros sociólogos ante la religión fue diversa a la de los filósofos de la Ilustración pues no consideraban este fenómeno como un momento pasajero lleno de supersticiones en la historia de la humanidad, sino como un aspecto casi imprescindible de la organización social. Así, Feuerbach en su obra La esencia del cristianismo trata la religión cristiana desde el punto de vista sociológico y afirma que se trata de una alienación de capacidades propiamente humanas. Se ocupa además de algunos aspectos de la religión como el dogma, la liturgia y la simbología. Por su parte, Alexis de Tocqueville, en La democracia en América, realiza un análisis del catolicismo y del protestantismo dentro de las sociedades democráticas y desde un punto de vista sociológico. A partir de estos primeros pasos de la sociología, otros autores de gran renombre como Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Ferdinand Tönnies o Ernst Troeltsch dedicaron atentos estudios al fenómeno religioso dentro de la sociedad.\n\nEn el individuo, la religión existe como una tendencia que combina lo racional y lo irracional. A la hora de articularse, las religiones desarrollan doctrinas que intentan dar respuestas globales al individuo. Por este motivo, la mayoría de las grandes doctrinas religiosas han dado respuestas a preguntas relacionadas con la creación del universo, el propósito de la vida, la naturaleza humana, la definición de bien y mal, la moral, la escatología. Y del mismo modo elaboran diferentes códigos éticos, rituales y simbólicos. No obstante, toda religión intenta ofrecer una posición para vivir y entender la existencia del ser humano de una forma integral, incluyendo la dimensión espiritual, por lo que existen elementos comunes en todas ellas.\n\nEn las sociedades, a lo largo de la historia también han sido frecuentes las llamadas guerras de religión y las teocracias; es decir sociedades provistas de un gobierno cuya legitimidad descansa en un sistema de ideas religiosas. En ellas se atribuía un valor divino al soberano de la civilización, Mesopotamia, Egipto, Roma, Tíbet y el imperio Inca son significativos. En estos casos la ley es a la vez autoridad jurídica y religiosa. Un ejemplo contemporáneo que sobrevive es el Reino Unido, en donde la reina es «gobernadora suprema» de la Iglesia anglicana los territorios de Inglaterra y Gales, en donde aprueba el nombramiento de obispos dentro de dichos territorios.\n\nEn el siglo XX, Talcott Parsons deja constancia de la relación entre la religión y la sociedad, incluida la «cibernética»: genera valores, modifica las normas, influye en los roles sociales, y da una guía para los sistemas de la sociedad, de la personalidad y del comportamiento. Su sistema es considerado como una nueva aplicación de teorías evolucionistas a la religión. De ahí que uno de sus alumnos, Robert Bellah haya publicado Evolución religiosa.\n\nLa religión ha sido para algunas sociedades un símbolo de su identidad. Del mismo modo, la religión aparece como pieza fundamental en la ordenación moral de las sociedades y actuando de manera influyente en su orden legislativo. Esta relación puede ser vista como beneficiosa o perjudicial según como ha evolucionado esa acomodación.[45]​\n\nNormalmente la antropología cultural ha dirigido su atención al estudio de las manifestaciones religiosas en las sociedades que no conocen la escritura fijándose sobre todo en sus creencias y prácticas. Esta disciplina parte de distintos fundamentos al afrontar la religión. Por un lado, la teoría de los «hechos sociales» de Durkheim; por otro, los «tipos ideales» de Max Weber pero también las investigaciones sea de freudianos sea del marxismo acerca de las expresiones de la religiosidad. Los aspectos más representativos del estudio antropológico son los que tienen por objeto dilucidar las relaciones de la religión con los demás aspectos de la vida cultural: las leyes, la política, la economía, la ética. Sin embargo, no se ha logrado un consenso en relación con el método: el problema resulta complejo ya que un método explicativo implica un cierto grado de objetividad, y se contesta la posibilidad de que un estudioso no tenga preconceptos en relación con la religión, y un método interpretativo permite diversos acercamientos y respuestas. De cualquier forma, el primer paso consiste en agrupar y enumerar los varios usos y prácticas religiosas para luego buscar semejanzas o posibles orígenes comunes. En el año 1980, James Peacock y Thomas Kirsch publican un libro que intenta una vía intermedia para explicar desde la antropología el desarrollo de roles distintos en las religiones.[46]​\n\nDespués de esta publicación, los estudios se han ido centrando en tratar de determinar el origen de la religión. Así, ya desde 1965 Evans-Pritchard publican el libro Teorías acerca de la religión primitiva, que es una suerte de recolección de las interpretaciones y teorías que se han dado acerca del origen de la religión en las culturas humanas desde una perspectiva evolucionista. Las variantes propuestas son muchas: la magia, el totemismo, el politeísmo, el fetichismo, el animismo, etc.: sin embargo, Evans-Pritchard subraya la dificultad de demostrar que algunas de estas manifestaciones —que se presentarían como origen de la religión o la «primera» religión— sea aislable e independiente de otras manifestaciones cronológicamente contemporáneas. Las críticas y disputas se dieron especialmente ante los esquemas darwinistas que sugerían el paso del mito a la magia y de esta a la religión. Este tema del origen de la religión y el problema de las diferencias entre las religiones es el objetivo temático de la antropología cultural en el siglo XXI ya que ha abandonado su interés inicial por elaborar una especie de catálogo de todas las religiones y sus manifestaciones y prácticas.\n\nSegún Anthony F. C. Wallace y Olivier Herrenschmidt,[47]​ la religión es una actividad social que pone de manifiesto la existencia de creencias en seres o realidades sobrenaturales, esta actividad se declara mediante prácticas rituales que tienen como objetivo establecer relaciones entre los participantes y esas fuerzas sagradas. Las creencias tienen como objeto de su fe potencias o seres divinos y trascendentes, y las prácticas rituales que sustantivan esta relación son radicalmente diferentes de otros comportamientos sociales: son estrictamente formales (estilizadas, repetitivas y estereotipadas), y a diferencia de una representación, los participantes se lo toman con la plena seriedad de tener la creencia de estar haciendo algo performativo.[48]​\n\nBronislaw Malinowski[49]​ advierte que no hay que confundir la religión con la magia. Desde la cultura del hombre primitivo, religión y magia ya tenían funciones diferentes: la magia es práctica, técnica, de creencia sencilla, primordial, medio para un fin, en manos de especialistas con oscuras iniciaciones y con resultados inmediatos, mientras que la religión no muestra una utilidad directa ni se aprehende con conjuros, el mundo sobrenatural a que hace referencia es complejo e integra la vida futura en una cosmogonía teleológica, es un fin moral en sí, es un asunto de todos y se concelebra en comunidad y su función última apunta a establecer, fijar e intensificar actitudes que cohesionen a la sociedad.[50]​ Igualmente propone huir de ciertas trampas que una visión euro o cristianocéntrica puede provocar, renunciando a asignar a la religión ideas como: solo los hombres, y no los animales, tienen alma; existe una separación absoluta entre lo profano y lo sagrado, el monoteísmo es el modelo o meta, siendo el politeísmo residual, y también sugieren alejarse, finalmente, de una cierta fenomenología de la religión, que pretende que las religiones no son sino el fenómeno de una esencia incognoscible.[51]​\n\nDada la universalidad de su expresión, no se puede hablar de religión, sino de religiones, con una concreción histórica definida. Esta existencia históricamente definida permite hablar de diferentes roles de la religión: desde aquel que permitió al hombre primitivo adaptarse a la aterradora realidad reflexiva que le enfrentó a su propia muerte hasta el de ser herramienta de control social o de creación de comunidad social, o el de actuar como una herramienta de ecología, en tanto que adaptación cultural en un entorno rudo o cambiante, o un instrumento de cambio social, ya si es de progreso como si es de regresión.[52]​\n\nCada una de estas funciones viene enmarcada en un discurso religioso, un discurso que establece una relación entre el conocimiento incorporado al discurso y el poder de la posesión de dicho conocimiento. Este discurso mantiene una relación de dependencia con la organización social donde se desarrolla,[51]​ de tal manera que determinados tipos de sociedad tenderán a generar un tipo de religión, el discurso de la cual, en su sentido axiológico y pedagógico, querrá instaurar intencionadamente un determinado sentido de la existencia y de la realidad.[51]​\n\nFinalmente hay que tener en cuenta la existencia de dos formas de entender la relación religiosa con el objeto de culto: la mediata y la inmediata. La relación inmediata, menos atractiva para el antropólogo, está basada en la unión mística del creyente con la divinidad. La relación mediata, que es la base de la práctica colectiva y ordinaria, está basada en la existencia de un intermediario.\n\nSurge junto con el estudio de las religiones comparadas y con el psicoanálisis. Su método va desde la medida con instrumentos propios de las ciencias exactas -como por ejemplo los estudios de laboratorio propios del siglo XIX- hasta la introspección.\n\nUno de los pioneros de la psicología de la religión fue Wilhelm Wundt que consideraba cuatro etapas de la historia de la conciencia. El elemento unificador de ellas es el combate de la persona por afirmarse en el mundo físico. Se trata de las siguientes: el ritual primitivo, el totemismo, los mitos sobre los héroes y dioses y el humanismo. Por otro lado, Oswald Külpe introdujo otros métodos para estudiar la religión tales como las entrevistas y los cuestionarios de datos autobiográficos. Así las dos tendencias de la psicología del siglo XIX —el estudio introspectivo por un lado y el análisis objetivo por otro— se entrelazan también al aplicarse a la religión.\n\nEn Estados Unidos la psicología nació como disciplina independiente. Stanley Hall creó un equipo de investigación que introdujo métodos empíricos para el estudio de la religión. En 1881 dio cursos sobre la relación entre la pubertad y la conversión religiosa y en el año 1904 fundó una revista llamada The American Journal of Religious Psychology and Education. Algunos de sus alumnos como James Leuba se dedicaron de por vida al estudio de la psicología de la religión.\n\nEn 1899, otro de sus alumnos, E. D. Starbuck publicó el primer tratado de psicología de la religión -The Psychology of Religion- que trataba las coincidencias en la descripción de la pubertad, de la dementia precox y la conversión religiosa. Fue una obra controvertida.\n\nEn el año 1902, William James publicó The varieties of religious experience donde centra su estudio en la unicidad de las experiencias morales y religiosas a partir de métodos de análisis introspectivo. En ese mismo período, Pierre Janet y Sigmund Freud iniciaron sus estudios a partir del subconsciente.\n\nFreud consideraba todos los ritos y creencias religiosas como proyecciones inconscientes de los conflictos internos a la familia que afirman la posición del yo en la sociedad: así en el ámbito propio de las creencias religiosas y partiendo de ellas, tales conflictos podrían resolverse. La religión habría nacido del sentimiento de culpa por el asesinato de la figura del padre, culpabilidad que sería liberada a través del sacrificio religioso. Incluso cuando reconocía ventajas en la religión, buscó promover un mayor realismo y resignación dado que la religión contendría muchas fijaciones infantiles.[53]​\n\nUno de los alumnos de Freud, Carl Gustav Jung se ocupó también del tema religioso. Consideraba la religión como una manifestación de un nivel más profundo de la conciencia o al menos más profundo que el ámbito sexual sostenido por su maestro. A partir de sus estudios sobre la Alquimia, llegó a la conclusión que la religión podía ser también una forma de unir consciente con inconsciente en un «yo individuado» y confirmar así su teoría de los arquetipos.\n\nSiguiendo esos pasos, otro discípulo de Freud, Eric Erikson, desarrolló más la teoría evolutiva de la conciencia que partiría de la creencia religiosa para unificarse.\n\nIncluso cuando las aproximaciones que dependen de Freud y de Jung sean las más influyentes también se dieron en Europa algunas otras interpretaciones, como por ejemplo la que intentó fundar una psicología de la religión a partir de los instrumentos de la teoría del conocimiento de Kant (véanse por ejemplo, los trabajos de Richard Müller-Freienfels.\n\nLos modernos desarrollos afirman a la psicología de la religión como un ámbito demasiado reciente de estudio, en donde buena parte de lo que se considera experiencia religiosa no puede ser admitido bajo criterios empíricos a la vez que se contrastan efectos beneficiosos y duraderos para el individuo, por lo que es una disciplina de creciente interés y actividad.[54]​\n\nEn las principales religiones encontramos lo que se suelen llamar experiencias místicas o trascendentes como una base fundacional de la experiencia religiosa. La mística se refiere a conseguir de manera experiencial la identidad, comunión o consciencia plena de la última realidad que presentan las religiones; ya sea una verdad, un estado de consciencia, o una o varias deidades. Las experiencias místicas no se atienen al razonamiento lógico y la comprensión intelectual. A un seguidor religioso que esté desarrollando esta faceta de su religión se le llama místico. En la mística por tanto prima la introspección respecto a la extraversión, y en ella se establece una relación de carácter más directo y personal entre el individuo y su religión. Históricamente en algunas religiones determinadas, la mística es la primera fuente de autoridad en las diversas interpretaciones. En las principales religiones se suelen distinguir escuelas, tradiciones o movimientos místicos.\n\nAunque en principio la mayoría de religiones son doctrinalmente facilitadoras de estas experiencias místicas, también a menudo las organizaciones religiosas no las han tolerado, considerándolas un contrapoder a la hora de interpretar los significados religiosos en sociedad. En el cristianismo, la Inquisición católica o algunas reformas protestantes persiguieron diferentes variantes del misticismo clasificándolas como herejías. En el islamismo, el sufismo ha experimentado dificultades tras la gran Reforma. El clero del budismo tibetano o japonés arrinconó doctrinalmente algunos enfoques contemplativos que no eran de su agrado debido a sus consecuencias sociales.\n\nEntre los intelectuales occidentales, el misticismo ha tenido defensores y detractores dentro y fuera de las religiones. A partir del siglo XIX, la observación de la religión proveniente del materialismo histórico la considerará de manera crítica. Émile Durkheim la atribuye a una 'efervescencia colectiva' en el contexto social en el que tales experiencias se producen.\n\nWilliam James encabezará una interpretación psicológica que enmarcará a la experiencia mística de las religiones como parte de algo mucho más amplio y no exclusivo de ellas. A partir del siglo XX, con autores como Mircea Eliade se abre una nueva etapa más sosegada y científica para el estudio de las religiones y para la consideración de la mística. Actualmente, interpretaciones como las de Csikszentmihalyi hablan de teorías de un «estado de flujo» que puede aparecer en la mente humana realizando diversas actividades que exijan concentración, provocando determinado estado de felicidad. La exploración científica más moderna de los ámbitos de contemplación, éxtasis y meditación común a la mística de las distintas religiones arrojan conclusiones tan espectaculares como abiertas a la especulación, siendo este un terreno tan interesante como inexplorado para la ciencia.[55]​\n\nEn muchos casos, en las religiones de Asia oriental, la mística y la especulación filosófica no han sufrido tantas dificultades históricas, estando integradas en la práctica religiosa de sus seguidores. En la actualidad los teólogos del cristianismo están divididos, unos apuestan por dar más énfasis a la mística,[56]​ mientras otros abogan por separar la mística de la ciencia, diferenciando la experiencia de la fe de los hechos históricos.[57]​ En el islamismo, el sufismo gana adeptos con rapidez tanto en Europa como en los países islámicos.[58]​\n\nEl conocimiento religioso, según los seguidores de las religiones, puede ser obtenido de líderes religiosos, textos sagrados y/o la propia revelación personal. Algunos puntos de vista de las religiones observan este conocimiento como ilimitado en alcance y capaz de resolver cualquier pregunta, otras le otorgan un rol más restringido o acompañando al conocimiento obtenido mediante la observación de los fenómenos físicos. Algunas religiones otorgan al conocimiento religioso la característica de ser infalible.\n\nMuchos textos religiosos cuentan con muchos siglos de antigüedad: el Poema de Gilgamesh, el Libro de los Muertos, el Rig-veda, la Biblia, el Majábharata (con el Bhagavad-guita), el Ramaiana, los Puranás, el Corán. Estos textos no solo han sido de interés dentro de las propias religiones sino también especialmente para la filosofía en la disciplina de la Filosofía de la religión. Esta estudia[39]​ las diferentes concepciones teístas o no teístas, la cosmología de las religiones así como sus argumentos de diseño, el misticismo, el problema del mal, la epistemología y así un amplio espectro de asuntos que son tratados desde el aparato intelectual filosófico.\n\nEn el ámbito hispano existen escritores, filósofos y teólogos de renombre que se han ocupado de la filosofía de la religión. Entre ellos Ciro Alegría, Leonardo Boff, Jorge Luis Borges, Lluis Busquets i Grabulosa, Pedro Laín Entralgo, Benjamín Forcano, David Flusser, José Ortega y Gasset, Octavio Paz, Xabier Picaza, Margarita Pinto, Miguel de Unamuno, Miguel Sarmiento.\n\nEn las religiones existen a menudo grandes desarrollos filosóficos cuya misión es aclarar o conciliar la doctrina religiosa con la razón humana. En las religiones teístas se conoce a este desarrollo como Teología. En Asia oriental, muchas veces, aunque los desarrollos filosóficos son grandes y variados, no existen como disciplina diferenciada dentro de la propia religión, filosofía y religión está entrelazada. En otras religiones no existe un aparato filosófico, en especial en las religiones tribales y chamánicas. Los desarrollos filosóficos de las religiones recogen los distintos aspectos de la doctrina religiosa o la verdad o deidad que las sustenta, y que son históricamente la explicación a las distintos puntos de vista dentro de cada religión.\n• Panteísmo es un punto de vista filosófico en donde toda la realidad tiene una naturaleza divina, por lo que se rechaza la idea de una entidad sagrada o Dios que sea personal. Filósofos como Spinoza se adhirieron al panteísmo, identificando la Naturaleza como Dios. Religiones orientales como el sintoísmo japonés o el taoísmo chino tienen una enorme carga panteísta.\n• Monismo es un punto de vista filosófico que subraya la unidad de todo lo que existe, afirmando unas leyes subyacentes que niegan las divisiones en ella. El monismo por tanto se distancia de observar un dualismo o pluralismo. Los orígenes del monismo remiten a los filósofos griegos como Tales de Mileto, Pitágoras, Parménides o Empédocles. El monismo fue una visión frecuente en filósofos neoplatónicos como Plotino, el filósofo más influyente en los primeros Padres de la Cristiandad[cita requerida]. El islamismo recoge una fuerte influencia también desde los griegos, y en el hinduismo es otro ingrediente importante en su enorme diversidad filosófica.\n• Gnosticismo afirma una dualidad inherente en la manifestación de lo sagrado. Materia y espíritu, bien y mal así como otros conceptos, aparecen como opuestos que deben ser resueltos en el individuo dando primacía a una vía de conocimiento a menudo bastante experiencial. El gnosticismo ha tenido una fuerte influencia en los primeros desarrollos del cristianismo, y desde la perspectiva filosófica occidental es un enfoque presente en los desarrollos de las religiones orientales.\n• Fundamentalismo afirma el carácter literal de las escrituras o relatos sagrados, negando por tanto sus significados más simbólicos o psicológicos. También es conocida como literalismo. Está muy circunscrito a las religiones teístas y actualmente es popular en varios movimientos protestantes de Estados Unidos. La visión fundamentalista del teísmo supone en muchas ocasiones una negación radical de las verdades científicas. Una de las derivaciones del enfoque fundamentalista es el Creacionismo, que niega la evolución de las especies y las teorías científicas sobre el origen del universo, al afirmar que el relato bíblico de la creación del mundo es literalmente auténtico.\n• No teísmo afirma la inexistencia de deidades o bien las admite pero les niega un papel directamente activo en la liberación del individuo. El no teísmo, también denominado ateísmo, existe en el budismo y el taoísmo. En algunas variantes del budismo existe el culto a deidades si bien tienen un papel psicológico, ritual o simbólico, pero en todo caso siempre provisional. El taoísmo observa dos variantes unidas pero bien diferenciadas: la filosófica y la más contemplativa o de meditación. En este último, las deidades de la religión tradicional china han sido absorbidas como elementos simbólicos para prácticas de carácter psicofísico.\n• Determinismo es una doctrina filosófica que afirma que todo acontecimiento, incluyendo el pensamiento humano y las acciones, están predeterminadas por una cadena de causa y consecuencia. En las religiones esta postura filosófica se enmarca dentro de la doctrina de la Predestinación. Este punto de vista asume que una deidad que sea omnipotente o una ley absoluta no puede dejar nada al azar. La doctrina de la predestinación fue importante en el protestantismo cristiano, especialmente en el movimiento Calvinista. En las religiones orientales como el hinduismo o el budismo, existe la doctrina del karma que asume una ley universal de causa y efecto. Pero el karma depende de la intencionalidad de los seres conscientes; las consecuencias son causadas por decisiones de estos, lo cual no implica una predeterminación o destino. Por medio de la creencia en la reencarnación, la creencia en la predestinación es muy alta en el hinduismo. En el budismo está también difundida a nivel popular, si bien doctrinalmente supone una distorsión del pensamiento de Buda. 59 ​\n• Sincretismo supone la conciliación de puntos de vista distintos e incluso opuestos. En las religiones el sincretismo implica adoptar elementos de dos o más religiones. El sincretismo ritual y devocional es una constante en la evolución de las religiones a través de su historia cuando han contactado unas con otras, si bien esos elementos se van asimilando en el tiempo dentro de una sola religión. Actualmente se consideran religiones sincréticas varios cultos caribeños y americanos que mezclan catolicismo y prácticas e ideas de las religiones tribales. En oriente se realiza un sincretismo devocional a nivel popular, uniendo al taoísmo o al budismo con las prácticas ancestrales de culto a los antepasados. En Occidente el sincretismo está más presente por la creación de nuevas sectas que suelen diseñarse mezclando ideas y elementos de las grandes religiones.\n\nLa mayoría de religiones suelen tener una parte de conocimiento exotérico y otra esotérico.\n• El lado exotérico de la religión se refiere a un conocimiento que es público, inteligible y accesible.\n• El lado esotérico se refiere a aquella parte que es secreta o discreta, críptica, o a la que se accede por mecanismos jerárquicos de confianza entre sus miembros.\n\nEn casi todas las grandes religiones ambas facetas existen. Las religiones teístas suelen aludir al acceso al conocimiento esotérico como un don o bendición de la deidad hacia la persona. En el cristianismo por ejemplo, el concepto de Gracia se considera un don de Dios que entre otras cosas permite a la persona penetrar en significados más profundos. Similares ideas existen en la religión musulmana y judía.\n\nEn otras religiones, el conocimiento esotérico suele afirmarse como un mecanismo de transmisión oral, en ocasiones al margen de las escrituras sagradas o de aquellas que son públicas. El budismo tiene algunas variantes, especialmente aquellas provenientes del budismo tibetano, que son fuertemente esotéricas. El taoísmo tiene en su faceta contemplativa algunos complicados métodos psicofísicos con un fuerte componente esotérico y de iniciación.\n\nNormalmente, en las propias religiones coexisten puntos de vista distintos que tienden a rechazar o afianzar el lado esotérico.\n\nEn ocasiones es importante distinguir entre «religión» y «postura religiosa». Siendo la religión un sistema de creencias, preceptos, prácticas y rituales, una postura religiosa se refiere a la forma como un individuo se identifica frente a una o varias religiones. Por otro lado, existe la postura de quienes niegan el valor o la utilidad de las religiones, las niegan o las adecúan a sus propios planteamientos personales o de grupo. También se observan diferentes posturas religiosas en los enfoques de aplicación a la sociedad en temas como el laicismo o el diálogo interreligioso.\n• Religiosas: afirma la pertenencia a alguna religión o credo.\n• Practicantes: asumen algún mensaje o contenido religioso e intentan ponerlo en práctica siguiendo prácticas, ritos o celebraciones.\n• No practicantes: asumen algún mensaje o contenido religioso pero no participan de prácticas, ritos o celebraciones.\n• No religiosas: niegan explícitamente la pertenencia a alguna religión o credo, o están en desacuerdo con los contenidos de las religiones.\n• Ateos: (del griego a=sin teo=dios) sin dios. Ateo es quien vive ajeno a la consideración de alguna deidad que influya en la realidad. El término ateísmo se puede referir a dos actitudes distintas: la indiferencia por la existencia de divinidades o la no creencia en la posibilidad de su existencia.\n• apateístas: un ateísmo en el que se mantienen una postura de considerar que la posible existencia de deidades y la búsqueda de conocimiento al respecto no es importante, y que en consecuencia el debate al respecto debe ser ignorado. Según Étienne Borne, el apateísmo supone un ateísmo llevado a la práctica.\n• Agnósticos: postura que niega la posibilidad de conocer alguna verdad religiosa. El agnóstico afirma que no hay certeza para asegurar cuál de las diferentes verdades incompatibles que presentan las religiones es la verdadera. Ello no implica que carezcan necesariamente de interés por lo espiritual, sino que no realizan afirmaciones ni sostienen creencias específicas sobre la realidad en términos religiosos. Quienes mantienen la postura agnóstica pueden no ser necesariamente antirreligiosos y pueden ser respetuosos con todas las creencias.\n• Ignósticos: El ignosticismo o igteísmo es la posición respecto a la creencia de Dios, en que primero se cuestiona la definición de Dios. El ignóstico o igteísta se pregunta: ¿qué se entiende por Dios? Recién una vez que se conozca la respuesta se podrá comprobar si Dios existe o no existe.\n• Fundamentalismo: el fundamentalismo se basa en la aplicación de un dogma o creencia de manera literal, sea religioso o de otro tipo, negando así el valor de otras explicaciones o la potencial ampliación de significados para cualquier certeza. El fundamentalismo elimina la posibilidad de coexistencia de interpretaciones diferentes de la realidad y la existencia, necesitando a menudo de su desaparición o eliminación para satisfacer un criterio único de verdad.\n• Fundamentalismo religioso: asume las explicaciones literales de los textos religiosos negando sus significados simbólicos, temporales o psicológicos. De manera general esto deriva en la negación y el deseo de eliminar otras explicaciones, ya vengan de otras posturas religiosas, de la ciencia o de la sociedad.\n• Fundamentalismo antirreligioso: asume las explicaciones literales de los textos no religiosos, negando sus significados temporales o ignorando la provisionalidad de las verdades científicas y sociales. De manera general deriva en la negación y el deseo de eliminar otras explicaciones, vengan desde posturas religiosas o desde visiones diferente de la propia ciencia que sean contrarias a la propia.\n• Laicismo: la palabra viene del griego laikus (pueblo) en oposición a klerikus (clérigo). La palabra laico define por tanto a aquellos que no son clérigos, ya sea dentro de la organización religiosa como en toda la sociedad civil. El laicismo afirma la necesidad de una ordenación de la sociedad sin la participación directa de los clérigos y por lo tanto independiente de la influencia religiosa. La defensa del laicismo implica que deben ser los laicos quienes diseñen, ordenen y apliquen las leyes, usos y costumbres de una sociedad, dejando a los clérigos esa función solo para el ámbito de sus organizaciones religiosas. La libre práctica del laicismo está presente en la Antigua Grecia, cuya idiosincrasia fue la tolerancia religiosa. El laicismo supone una visión de la sociedad cuya defensa ha existido históricamente tanto dentro como fuera de las religiones. Del mismo modo, los ataques a esta postura han existido también desde dentro y fuera de las religiones. En el laicismo cohabitan diferentes visiones, desde aquellas que se muestran respetuosas con la existencia del hecho religioso hasta aquellas más fundamentalistas que lo reinterpretan como un vehículo para la erradicación de las religiones. Del mismo modo, en las religiones coexisten diferentes posturas que asumen al laicismo como algo beneficioso o no perjudicial, hasta aquellas que lo reinterpretan como un mal inevitable pero que puede ser reformulado para mantener grados de injerencia religiosa en el poder civil.\n• Diálogo interreligioso: aunque históricamente las religiones del mundo han tenido contacto entre sí y conocimiento unas de otras, no será hasta el siglo cuando la humanidad establezca la necesidad pública de un canal de comunicación constante y activo en lo que se ha llamado diálogo interreligioso. Las principales religiones y sus líderes han efectuado en las últimas décadas llamamientos para aumentar este diálogo como vía para erradicar los fundamentalismos y contribuir a la paz en el mundo. Los encuentros de este tipo más famosos han sido los de Asís (Italia) teniendo como anfitriona a la iglesia católica y agrupando a las principales religiones del mundo, los de Getsemaní (Israel) realizados para un diálogo entre religiones occidentales y orientales, y recientemente el convocado por el islamismo de la mano del rey de Arabia Saudí, Abdullah Bin Abdelaziz, que por primera vez abre de manera explícita al islamismo a este tipo de encuentros.\n\nAndrés Salazar, profesor e investigador del Instituto de La Familia, es el coordinador del capítulo Colombia en la investigación internacional “Mapa Mundial de la Familia” (en inglés World Family Map). En el capítulo 2019, investigaron la relación de la fecundidad con la religión.[60]​\n\nEn los cinco países latinos en los que se hizo la encuesta, se encontró que los grupos de personas religiosas tienen más hijos que aquellos que ni practican ni están afiliados a una religión. La diferencia es cercana al 0.4; es decir, cuatro hijos más por cada diez personas. La principal conclusión es que las personas que están teniendo más hijos, son personas que están afiliadas a una religión.\n\nSe encontró que entre los grupos que tienen más hijos están las personas afiliadas al Islam, seguidos por los ortodoxos, mormones, otros cristianos e hindúes. En cuanto a los católicos y protestantes, se halló que el promedio en las tasas de fecundidad es un poco más bajo. Luego, se encuentran los que no están afiliados a una religión: hay dos grupos, los que se consideran espirituales, pero no de alguna religión (estos tienen más hijos) y los que dicen no serlo (es menor el promedio). Ambos grupos tienen menos hijos que los afiliados.\n\nHay autores que dicen que la religión puede influir en las actitudes y prácticas del matrimonio y, por lo tanto, en la fecundidad. Sin embargo, en Latinoamérica hay una baja nupcialidad, las tasas de matrimonio están entre el 20 % y 30 %, mientras que, en otros países, están en 60 % y 80 %. Esto podría explicar, en parte, la baja fecundidad en Latinoamérica (World Family Map, 2015).\n\nSegún Ferran Esteve, se puede observar en las conclusiones del estudio internacional en 19 países ‘¿Qué tienen que ver el matrimonio y la fecundidad con la economía’, elaborado por el Social Trends Institute (STI), que las familias coherentes con su religiosidad tienen más hijos que las no practicantes.[61]​\n\nEl estudio recuerda que el descenso de la fecundidad que se inició hace tiempo en Escandinavia, propagándose posteriormente al resto de Europa, “está fuertemente asociado a la difusión de valores seculares, el declive de la autoridad religiosa y el auge del individualismo”.\n\nEsa revolución de los valores culturales tradicionales que se popularizó en la década de los sesenta llevó a un “cambio de actitud hacia el divorcio, la anticoncepción, el sexo, el tener hijos siendo solteros y la religión”.\n\nEsas actitudes se difundieron rápidamente hacia el sur, “a través de España, Portugal, Italia y Grecia en los últimos años de la década de los setenta y a lo largo de los ochenta”, mientras las tasas de nupcialidad y de fecundidad iban cayendo, añade el estudio.\n\nComo contraste, actualmente sigue dándose una “fuerte y creciente correlación entre los valores religiosos y las familias más numerosas que la media”, destaca el informe.\n\nUn análisis de 53 países de todas las regiones del mundo, desde África a Oceanía, pasando por las Américas y desde la Europa central a la oriental, indica que los hombres y las mujeres que asisten a los oficios religiosos al menos una vez al mes o más tienen 0,5 más hijos de media que los que asisten con menos frecuencia o no lo hacen nunca.\n\nEn Francia, por ejemplo, las mujeres blancas practicantes aventajan en fecundidad media a las mujeres blancas no religiosas y, como el científico político Eric Kaufman señala, esta disparidad ha crecido a lo largo de los años, indica el estudio.\n\nEn España, las mujeres católicas practicantes tienen un número significativamente mayor de hijos que las católicas no practicantes, teniendo en cuenta los ingresos, el estado civil, la educación y otras constantes.\n\nEste contraste se puede observar en el resto del mundo: las personas religiosas suelen tener un número de hijos considerablemente mayor que el resto de la población, concluyen los responsables del informe.\n\nCatólico/a 41.2%, Evangélico/a 5.5%, Testigo/a de Jehová 1.1%, Mormón/a 0.4%, Adventista 0.3%, Judío/a 0.1%, Otro 1.4%, Ninguna 31.3%, Ateo/a 1.6%, Agnóstico/a 0.6%, No

Two of them, Microsoft Public License and Microsoft Reciprocal License, have been approved by the Open Source Initiative as open source licenses[3][4] and are regarded by the Free Software Foundation as free software licenses.[5] Other shared source licenses are proprietary, and thus allow the copyright holder to retain tighter control over the use of their product.\n\nMicrosoft's Shared Source Initiative has been imitated by other companies such as RISC OS Open Ltd.[6]\n\nMicrosoft also uses specific licenses for some of their products, such as the Shared Source CLI License[7] and the Microsoft Windows Embedded CE 6.0 Shared Source License.[8]\n\nThe following licenses are considered open-source by the Open Source Initiative and free by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nThis is the least restrictive of the Microsoft licenses and allows for distribution of compiled code for either commercial or non-commercial purposes under any license that complies with the Ms-PL. Redistribution of the source code itself is permitted only under the Ms-PL.[9] Initially titled Microsoft Permissive License, it was renamed to Microsoft Public License while being reviewed for approval by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).[10] The license was approved on October 12, 2007, along with the Ms-RL.[11] According to the Free Software Foundation, it is a free software license but not compatible with the GNU GPL.[5] Ms-PL provides a free and flexible licensing for developers using source codes under this license. However, the Ms-PL is a copyleft license because it requires the source code of software it governs to be distributed only under the same license (the Ms-PL).[12]\n\nThis Microsoft license allows for distribution of derived code so long as the modified source files are included and retain the Ms-RL.[13] The Ms-RL allows those files in the distribution that do not contain code originally licensed under Ms-RL to be licensed according to the copyright holder's choosing. This is similar, but not the same as the CDDL, EPL or LGPL (GPL with a typical \"linking exception\").[citation needed] Initially known as the Microsoft Community License, it was renamed during the OSI approval process.\n\nOn December 9, 2005, the Ms-RL license was submitted to the Open Source Initiative for approval by John Cowan.[14] OSI then contacted Microsoft and asked if they wanted OSI to proceed. Microsoft replied that they did not wish to be reactive and that they needed time to review such a decision.[15]\n\nAt the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in July 2007, Bill Hilf, director of Microsoft's work with open source projects, announced that Microsoft had formally submitted Ms-PL and Ms-RL to OSI for approval.[16] It was approved on October 12, 2007, along with the Ms-PL.[11] According to the Free Software Foundation, it is a free software license but not compatible with the GNU GPL.[5]\n\nThe following source-available software licenses have limitations that prevent them from being open-source according to the Open Source Initiative and free to the Free Software Foundation.\n\nThis is a version of the Microsoft Public License in which rights are only granted to developers of Microsoft Windows-based software.[17] This license is not open source, as defined by the OSI, because the restriction limiting use of the software to Windows violates the stipulation that open-source licenses must be technology-neutral.[18] It is also considered to be non-free by the Free Software Foundation due to this restriction.[5]\n\nThis is a version of the Microsoft Reciprocal License in which rights are only granted when developing software for a Microsoft Windows platform.[19] Like the Ms-LPL, this license is not open source because it is not technology-neutral[18] due to its restriction that licensed software must be used on Windows, and is also not considered free by the Free Software Foundation due to this restriction.[5]\n\nThis is the most restrictive of the Microsoft Shared Source licenses. The source code is made available to view for reference purposes only, mainly to be able to view Microsoft classes source code while debugging.[20] Developers may not distribute or modify the code for commercial or non-commercial purposes.[21] The license has previously been abbreviated Ms-RL, but Ms-RL now refers to the Microsoft Reciprocal License.[13]\n\nTwo specific shared source licenses are interpreted as free software and open source licenses by FSF and OSI. However, former OSI president Michael Tiemann considers the phrase \"Shared Source\" itself to be a marketing term created by Microsoft. He argues that it is \"an insurgent term that distracts and dilutes the Open Source message by using similar-sounding terms and offering similar-sounding promises\".[22]\n\nThe Shared Source Initiative has also been noted to increase the problem of license proliferation.[23]The: The Shared Course Initiative connects language classrooms at Columbia, Cornell, and Yale via high-definition videoconferencing.\n\nCheck out the Spring 2025 course offerings, which include 21 Less Commonly Taught Languages and 50 individual language classes.Microsoft, Proprietary Code and the Shared Source Initiative: In a move to build better relationships with certain classes of customer, Microsoft in 2001 began allowing them to look at portions of Windows source code. Several programs were set up, serving selected enterprises, “most valuable professionals,” OEMs, system integrators, academics and several other customer categories all grouped under one heading: the Shared Source Initiative.\n\nA later addition to the scheme, launched in January 2003, was the Government Security Program (GSP). Under its auspices, government agencies from qualifying countries can view source code for current versions, beta releases and service packs of Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows CE.\n\nIn addition, says Microsoft — subject to such requirements as U.S. export approval — qualified GSP participants also can obtain access to cryptographic code and development tools. There is one caveat, however: Participating bodies can’t modify the code except in limited circumstances in close collaboration with Microsoft.\n\n“The GSP was crafted specifically to address the burgeoning security concerns and vulnerabilities of national governments and their key agencies,” according to Jason Matusow, manager of the Shared Source Initiative program. “As a highly focused program targeting security issues, the GSP promotes centralized coordination behind a sponsoring national agency that focuses on security as its core mission or priority (typically, the national interior ministry, IT ministry or a dedicated security department). This agency ordinarily conducts the overall security review on behalf of the central government, and then may bring other agencies into the source-access program as warranted to undertake specific security-related projects.”\n\nJupiter Research’s Microsoft specialist, Joe Wilcox, doesn’t disagree — but like other industry observers, he believes this is only half the story. “Keep in mind,” he told TechNewsWorld, “that Microsoft is a U.S. company, and there can be concerns that a U.S. company might have some ‘support’ from the government — some back doors into the software, that kind of thing. Those suspicions don’t have to be true to be a problem for Microsoft. By allowing some access to the code, it can alleviate those fears and fears around security in general.”\n\nWilcox, who said he views the program as a response to the “open-source threat,” pointed out that several countries have incentives to consider alternatives to Microsoft software and even to any U.S.-produced commercial software. “Countries like China, India and Russia,” he noted, “have good reasons to try and develop their own indigenous software industries. And one way to do that is to build around open-source projects like Linux. With this program, Microsoft is trying to present them with an alternative.”\n\nDoes the Shared Source Initiative — and the GSP in particular — represent a shift in Microsoft’s thinking about “openness” in software? Certainly, the section of its Web site dealing with the general topic of open-source software sounds surprisingly positive.\n\n“Microsoft believes the results of government-funded basic research should be widely available and that permissive open-source licenses often maximize availability and usefulness,” it says. “Open-source software is one important part of the software ecosystem.” What Microsoft wants, according to the document, is “neutral public procurement rules that allow governments to select software that offers them the greatest value.”\n\nBut security consultant Richard Forno, author of The Art of Information Warfare and other books, sees the GSP as representing no real change in Microsoft’s approach. It is, he believes, more a matter of perception than of substance: “My gut feeling is that it is to present the appearance of openness and getting some trust. It’s ‘shared’ source, but it’s not ‘open’ source.”\n\nAccording to Microsoft’s Matusow, about 60 nations’ governments have been approved for participation, and more than 30 are now on board. Approval under the GSP is granted largely on the basis of a country’s intellectual-property laws, which Microsoft says must be able to protect its copyrights.\n\nChina, in fact, seems to have been one of the earliest participants, even though the Chinese government is said to be leaning toward open-source procurement. Given China’s reputation on intellectual-property legal issues, this suggests some flexibility in Microsoft’s judgment of what it takes to protect its IP.\n\n“Steve Ballmer has made several trips over there, meeting with ministers and cabinet-level folks, trying to get them to tighten up their IP controls and regulations,” said Forno. “Obviously, that’s a huge market that Microsoft wants to break into, and I can understand their desire. But the last I heard, China is still proceeding with its own version of Linux and going with the open-source approach, for whatever reason. China certainly hasn’t improved its IP restrictions any.”\n\nBut according to Microsoft’s Matusow, “the GSP eligibility list continues to expand as more nations endeavor to bring their IP regimes into accord with international standards. The GSP agreement in China is the result of the ongoing commitment, partnership and investment Microsoft has already made in the Chinese software industry…. We have a very positive, dynamically growing relationship with the People’s Republic of China, including several joint initiatives.”\n\nMicrosoft says a million individuals now have access to Windows source code through various parts of the Shared Source Initiative. To the uninitiated, that may sound like cause for sleepless nights in a company famously protective of its designs. “The GSP goes well beyond simple source access,” Matusow told TechNewsWorld. “Trust and partnership don’t happen simply because of source code availability.”\n\nAnd, as Joe Wilcox pointed out, “I think it’s safe to assume that anyone outside of Microsoft given access to the source code sees it under very controlled circumstances.”\n\nAt a practical level, such control might be provided by the access mechanism, which involves use of a smart card allowing developers to inspect the code from approved locations in an SSL-protected online format. Additional practical protection may be afforded by the sheer volume of the code.\n\n“We’re talking about millions of lines of code,” Wilcox pointed out. “Nobody’s going to get a quick look at that and be able to steal Microsoft intellectual property.”Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing: Microsoft has historically wrung great profits from proprietary software licensing. Its business model, along with its substantial profit margins, is completely dependent upon licensing access to the software that it controls. In response to the growing market for open source and free software in the last 15 years, Microsoft has made clear that it has no intention of changing its approach. In fact, its public position and actions seem to signify that the company is becoming more aggressive about its licensing programs and about protecting its intellectual property through strategies such as patent procurement and litigation.\n\nYet, historically, Microsoft has provided at least some business partners and customers access to its source code, as well as obtained access to the source code of others for inclusion in its products, or for ensuring interoperability. New demands are also growing: as a result of open source, the developer community is increasingly used to having liberal access to whatever source code it needs to conduct business; governments and customers now expect to be able to audit the source code that makes up the products that they depend upon daily; and academics and start-ups alike understand that open source is an efficient way to conduct shared research projects. As the open source movement continues to gain steam, Microsoft, like many other software companies, has felt pressure to provide public access to its source code.\n\nMicrosoft cannot easily turn to existing open source licenses and communities in order to solve this problem. Large-scale proprietary software products represent a complex web of legal relationships between all of those who own copyrights, trademarks, and patents that apply not only to the code, but also to arcane elements such as the communications protocols and media formats being used. Were Microsoft to relicense its code, all participants would have to be contacted and terms renegotiated, or else replacement code would need to be written and tested. As described in Chapter 3, when Netscape open source licensed its proprietary Communicator software under the Mozilla Public License, it had to negotiate with third-party providers of code that had been part of the Communicator system and had to rewrite substantial sections of code when some of those providers refused to permit their code to be released under the MPL. This is a difficult process, even for the largest companies.\n\nBeyond the legal difficulties involved, Microsoft's software business model could not possibly sustain the blow to its profit margins that would occur should its software become freely available. Companies that generate income through services or hardware businesses can piggyback directly on open source by refocusing on those aspects of their business. But with almost all of its revenues derived from the licensing of proprietary software, Microsoft needs an approach to source code access that permits it to continue to use its current business model.\n\nThe Microsoft Shared Source Initiative is Microsoft's attempt to solve this source code access dilemma. The Shared Source Initiative has many facets, and it is difficult to describe briefly. It can be most simply explained as an umbrella under which Microsoft positions its many different software-licensing practices. On its face, it is a program for facilitating access to Microsoft source code, but, considered more broadly, it is also a lobbying effort aimed at explaining and defending the benefits of strong intellectual property laws to the world at large.\n\nWithin this system, Microsoft has defined five key source code licensing attributes:\n\nUsing these attributes, Microsoft has carefully tailored a number of software licenses that grant more or less restricted access to the source code for many of its software products, depending upon a number of variables such as what country the licensee resides in; how important the product is to Microsoft's core business; and whether the software is being used for commercial purposes, charitable use, or academic research. For some products, such as Windows, there may be literally dozens of different licensing options.\n\nBecause the Microsoft Shared Source Initiative is so complex, and each license is the result of relatively laborious negotiation within Microsoft and between Microsoft and its users and developers—with product and location specificity built into each license—the project has none of the simplicity or transparency of open source and free software licenses. It is, at least at this time, little more than a branded extension of Microsoft's current commercial licensing practices.\n\nWithin Microsoft's existing business ecosystem, however, the Shared Source Initiative has already borne copious amounts of fruit. Awareness of the initiative within Microsoft product teams has resulted in standardized and simplified ways for customers, subcontractors, support firms, hardware vendors, academic researchers, and governments to obtain access to code that would have been off-limits or very difficult to access in the past. It has also catalyzed internal analysis and product planning, which has resulted in deeper Microsoft participation in existing open source communities and processes.\n\nBeyond the edges of the ecosystem populated by Microsoft dependents, reaction to the Shared Source Initiative has been much more ambivalent. To many people, the program seems to be little more than a series of carefully scaled permissions governing access to Microsoft's closely guarded source code. Although some of the licenses involved allow for unfettered change and redistribution of underlying code, the code to which these licenses apply is not core application or operating system code. Developers have no real opportunity to make changes to such core assets without first agreeing to very restrictive terms. As a result, the resulting collaboration between Microsoft and external developers bears little relationship to the open source or open source-like development relationships described in this and previous chapters.\n\nDespite its readily apparent lack of enthusiasm for them, Microsoft has been actively following developments in the open source movement and slowly adapting to them via the Shared Source Initiative. Microsoft has begun to use existing open source licenses for some of its newer projects. Although these projects are minor at this point, the trend is very likely to continue because of the great advantages that open source has to offer, even to Microsoft, at least under certain circumstances. Microsoft is also beginning to understand how open source approaches can be \"safely\" integrated with its traditional business practices, and as a result of this, Microsoft's intellectual property agenda is likely to cause profound change within existing open source practices, through litigation, lobbying, lawmaking, and \"coopetition.\" Although Microsoft's positioning of shared source as an alternative to open source might seem absurd, it should not be lightly dismissed.\n\nIn terms of placing various licensing models on a spectrum, the GPL or the BSD-model license would fall on one end, depending on the nature of the \"freedom\" being measured; obviously, the classic proprietary license would fall upon the other, in terms of the restrictions imposed on licensees. In the continuum would fall the Perl, the MPL, the SCSL and the other licenses already described. The Microsoft Shared Source Initiative falls quite near the classic proprietary model in its function: not a surprising result, considering that Microsoft is by far history's largest beneficiary of the proprietary software licensing model. But, nonetheless, it has already, at least with regards to some applications, moved closer to a true open source model, and the Initiative is a project worth watching.\n\nAs this book was going to press, Microsoft released its Windows Installer XML (WiX) technology under the Common Public License (CPL), an Open Source Initiative-approved license, at http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/. This marks a first, though how far Microsoft will go with such projects is yet to be seen."}

UNESCO sponsors projects that improve literacy, provide technical training and education, advance science, protect independent media and press freedom, preserve regional and cultural history, and promote cultural diversity.[12][13][14] The organization prominently helps establish and secure World Heritage Sites of cultural and natural importance.[15]\n\nUNESCO is governed by the General Conference composed of member states and associate members, which meets biannually to set the agency's programs and budget. It also elects members of the executive board, which manages UNESCO's work, and appoints every four years a Director-General, who serves as UNESCO's chief administrator.\n\nUNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced back to a League of Nations resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a commission to study the feasibility of having nations freely share cultural, educational and scientific achievements.[16][17] This new body, the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (ICIC), was created in 1922[10] and counted such figures as Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Robert A. Millikan, and Gonzague de Reynold among its members (being thus a small commission of the League of Nations essentially centred on Western Europe[18]). The International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) was then created in Paris in September 1924, to act as the executing agency for the ICIC.[19] However, the onset of World War II largely interrupted the work of these predecessor organizations.[20] As for private initiatives, the International Bureau of Education (IBE) began to work as a non-governmental organization in the service of international educational development since December 1925 and joined UNESCO in 1969, after having established a joint commission in 1952.[22]\n\nAfter the signing of the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United Nations, the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings in London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945. On 30 October 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United States and the USSR. This was followed by the Dumbarton Oaks Conference proposals of 9 October 1944. Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO), held in San Francisco from April to June 1945, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945 with 44 governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed by Rab Butler, the Minister of Education for the United Kingdom, who had a great deal of influence in its development.[23] At the ECO/CONF, the Constitution of UNESCO was introduced and signed by 37 countries, and a Preparatory Commission was established.[24] The Preparatory Commission operated between 16 November 1945, and 4 November 1946 — the date when UNESCO's Constitution came into force with the deposit of the twentieth ratification by a member state.\n\nThe first General Conference took place from 19 November to 10 December 1946, and elected Julian Huxley to Director-General.[26] United States Army colonel, university president and civil rights advocate Blake R. Van Leer joined as a member as well.[27] The Constitution was amended in November 1954 when the General Conference resolved that members of the executive board would be representatives of the governments of the States of which they are nationals and would not, as before, act in their personal capacity.[28] This change in governance distinguished UNESCO from its predecessor, the ICIC, in how member states would work together in the organization's fields of competence. As member states worked together over time to realize UNESCO's mandate, political and historical factors have shaped the organization's operations in particular during the Cold War, the decolonization process, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.[29][30]\n\nAmong the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism, for example through influential statements on race starting with a declaration of anthropologists (among them was Claude Lévi-Strauss) and other scientists in 1950 and concluding with the 1978 Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice.[31]\n\nIn 1955, the Republic of South Africa withdrew from UNESCO saying that some of the organization's publications amounted to \"interference\" in the country's \"racial problems\".[32] It rejoined the organization in 1994 under the leadership of Nelson Mandela.[33][34]\n\nOne of the early work of UNESCO in the education field was a pilot project on fundamental education in the Marbial Valley, Haiti, which was launched in 1947. Following this project one of expert missions to other countries, included a 1949 mission to Afghanistan.[35] UNESCO recommended in 1948 that Member countries should make free primary education compulsory and universal.[35] The World Conference on Education for All, in Jomtien, Thailand, started a global movement in 1990 to provide basic education for all children, youths and adults.[35] In 2000, World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, led member governments to commit for achieving basic education for all in 2015.[35]\n\nThe World Declaration on Higher Education was adopted by UNESCO's World Conference on Higher Education on 9 October 1998,[36] with the aim of setting global standards on the ideals and accessibility of higher education.\n\nUNESCO's early activities in culture included the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, launched in 1960.[37] The purpose of the campaign was to move the Great Temple of Abu Simbel to keep it from being swamped by the Nile after the construction of the Aswan Dam. During the 20-year campaign, 22 monuments and architectural complexes were relocated. This was the first and largest in a series of campaigns including Mohenjo-daro (Pakistan), Fes (Morocco), Kathmandu (Nepal), Borobudur (Indonesia) and the Acropolis of Athens (Greece).[38] The organization's work on heritage led to the adoption, in 1972, of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.[39] In 1976, the World Heritage Committee was established and the first sites were included on the World Heritage List in 1978.[40] Since then important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been adopted by UNESCO member states in 2003 (Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage)[41] and 2005 (Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions).[42]\n\nAn intergovernmental meeting of UNESCO in Paris in December 1951 led to the creation of the European Council for Nuclear Research, which was responsible for establishing the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)[43] later on, in 1954.[44]\n\nArid Zone programming, 1948–1966, is another example of an early major UNESCO project in the field of natural sciences.[45]\n\nIn 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, a problem that continues to be addressed in the field of sustainable development. The main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme.[46]\n\nUNESCO has been credited with the diffusion of national science bureaucracies.[47]\n\nIn the field of communication, the \"free flow of ideas by word and image\" has been in UNESCO's constitution since it was established, following the experience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in indoctrinating populations for aggression.[48] In the years immediately following World War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world. UNESCO started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s.[48] In response to calls for a \"New World Information and Communication Order\" in the late 1970s, UNESCO established the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems,[49] which produced the 1980 MacBride report (named after the chair of the commission, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Seán MacBride).[49] The same year, UNESCO created the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC), a multilateral forum designed to promote media development in developing countries.[50] In 1993, UNESCO's General Conference endorsed the Windhoek Declaration on media independence and pluralism, which led the UN General Assembly to declare the date of its adoption, 3 May, as World Press Freedom Day.[51] Since 1997, UNESCO has awarded the UNESCO / Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize every 3 May.[52]\n\nLaws passed in the United States after Palestine applied for UNESCO and WHO membership in April 1989[55][56] mean that the United States cannot contribute financially to any UN organization that accepts Palestine as a full member.[57][58] As a result, the United States withdrew its funding, which had accounted for about 22% of UNESCO's budget.[59] Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to UNESCO by freezing Israeli payments to UNESCO and imposing sanctions on the Palestinian Authority,[60] stating that Palestine's admittance would be detrimental \"to potential peace talks\".[61] Two years after stopping payment of its dues to UNESCO, the United States and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights in 2013 without losing the right to be elected; thus, the United States was elected as a member of the executive board for the period 2016–19.[62] In 2019, Israel left UNESCO after 69 years of membership, with Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon writing: \"UNESCO is the body that continually rewrites history, including by erasing the Jewish connection to Jerusalem... it is corrupted and manipulated by Israel's enemies... we are not going to be a member of an organization that deliberately acts against us\".[63]\n\n2023 saw Russia excluded from the executive committee for the first time, after failing to get sufficient votes.[64] The United States stated its intent to rejoin UNESCO in 2023, 5 years after leaving, and to pay its $600 million in back dues.[65] The United States was readmitted by the UNESCO General Conference that July.[66]\n\nUNESCO implements its activities through five programme areas: education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, and communication and information.[67]\n• UNESCO supports research in comparative education, provides expertise and fosters partnerships to strengthen national educational leadership and the capacity of countries to offer quality education for all. This includes the\n• UNESCO Chairs, an international network of 644 UNESCO chairs, involving more than 770 institutions in 126 countries\n• Convention against Discrimination in Education adopted in 1960\n• Organization of the International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA) in an interval of 12 years\n• Publication of the Education for All Global Monitoring Report\n• Publication of the Four Pillars of Learning seminal document\n• UNESCO ASPNet, an international network of more than 12,000 schools in 182 countries\n\nUNESCO does not accredit institutions of higher learning.[68]\n• UNESCO also issues public statements to educate the public:\n• Seville Statement on Violence: A statement adopted by UNESCO in 1989 to refute the notion that humans are biologically predisposed to organized violence.\n• Designating projects and places of cultural and scientific significance, such as:\n• Biosphere reserves, through the Programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB), since 1971\n• City of Literature; in 2007, the first city to be given this title was Edinburgh, the site of Scotland's first circulating library. 69 In 2008, Iowa City, Iowa, became the City of Literature. 70 71\n• Endangered languages and linguistic diversity projects (UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger)\n• Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\n• Memory of the World International Register, since 1997\n• Water resources management, through the International Hydrological Programme (IHP), since 1965\n• Encouraging the \"free flow of ideas by images and words\" by:\n• Promoting freedom of expression, including freedom of the press and freedom of information legislation, through the Division of Freedom of Expression and Media Development, 72 including the International Programme for the Development of Communication 73\n• Promoting the safety of journalists and combatting impunity for those who attack them, 74 through coordination of the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity 75\n• Promoting universal access to and preservation of information and open solutions for sustainable development through the Knowledge Societies Division, 76 including the Memory of the World Programme 77 and Information for All Programme 78\n• Promoting pluralism, gender equality and cultural diversity in the media\n• Promoting Internet Universality and its principles, that the Internet should be (I) human Rights-based, (ii) Open, (iii) Accessible to all, and (iv) nurtured by Multi-stakeholder participation (summarized as the acronym R.O.A.M.) 79\n• Generating knowledge through publications such as World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development, 80 the UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom, 81 and the Media Development Indicators, 82 as well as other indicator-based studies.\n• Promoting events, such as:\n• International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World: 2001–2010, proclaimed by the UN in 1998\n• World Press Freedom Day, 3 May each year, to promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press as a basic human right and as crucial components of any healthy, democratic and free society.\n• Criança Esperança in Brazil, in partnership with Rede Globo, to raise funds for community-based projects that foster social integration and violence prevention.\n• International Year for the Culture of Peace, 2000\n• Health Education for Behavior Change programme in partnership with the Ministry of Education of Kenya which was financially supported by the Government of Azerbaijan to promote health education among 10-19-year-old young people who live in informal camp in Kibera, Nairobi.

These two distinct sets of information are published on the IATI registry, respectively based on the IATI Activity Standard and the IATI Organization Standard.\n\nThere have been proposals to establish two new UNESCO lists. The first proposed list will focus on movable cultural heritage such as artifacts, paintings, and biofacts. The list may include cultural objects, such as the Jōmon Venus of Japan, the Mona Lisa of France, the Gebel el-Arak Knife of Egypt, The Ninth Wave of Russia, the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük of Turkey, the David (Michelangelo) of Italy, the Mathura Herakles of India, the Manunggul Jar of the Philippines, the Crown of Baekje of South Korea, The Hay Wain of the United Kingdom and the Benin Bronzes of Nigeria. The second proposed list will focus on the world's living species.[89][90]\n\nUNESCO and its specialized institutions issue a number of magazines.\n\nCreated in 1945, The UNESCO Courier magazine states its mission to \"promote UNESCO's ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and provide a forum for international debate\". Since March 2006 it has been available free online, with limited printed issues. Its articles express the opinions of the authors which are not necessarily the opinions of UNESCO. There was a hiatus in publishing between 2012 and 2017.[91]\n\nIn 1950, UNESCO initiated the quarterly review Impact of Science on Society (also known as Impact) to discuss the influence of science on society. The journal ceased publication in 1992.[92] UNESCO also published Museum International Quarterly from the year 1948.\n\nUNESCO has official relations with 322 international non-governmental organizations (NGOs).[93] Most of these are what UNESCO calls \"operational\"; a select few are \"formal\".[94] The highest form of affiliation to UNESCO is \"formal associate\", and the 22 NGOs[95] with formal associate (ASC) relations occupying offices at UNESCO are:\n\nThe institutes are specialized departments of the organization that support UNESCO's programme, providing specialized support for cluster and national offices.\n\nUNESCO awards 26 prizes[108] in education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, communication and information as well as peace:\n• UNESCO/Hamdan Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Prize for Outstanding Practice and Performance in Enhancing the Effectiveness of Teachers\n• UNESCO King Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa Prize for the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Education\n• UNESCO/Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science\n• UNESCO-Equatorial Guinea International Prize for Research in the Life Sciences\n• UNESCO-Al Fozan International Prize for the Promotion of Young Scientists in STEM\n• UNESCO/Juan Bosch Prize for the Promotion of Social Science Research in Latin America and the Caribbean\n• UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence\n• Melina Mercouri International Prize for the Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes (UNESCO-Greece)\n• UNESCO/Emir Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah Prize to promote Quality Education for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities\n• UNESCO/Obiang Nguema Mbasogo International Prize for Research in the Life Sciences (inactive since 2010)\n• UNESCO Prize for the Promotion of the Arts\n\nInternational Days observed at UNESCO are provided in the table below:[111]\n\nAs of July 2023 , UNESCO has 194 member states and 12 associate members.[122] Some members are not independent states and some members have additional National Organizing Committees from some of their dependent territories.[123] UNESCO state parties are the United Nations member states (except Israel[124] and Liechtenstein), as well as Cook Islands, Niue and Palestine.[125][126] The United States and Israel left UNESCO on 31 December 2018,[127][128] but the United States rejoined in 2023.[65][66]\n\nAs of June 2023 , there have been 11 Directors-General of UNESCO since its inception – nine men and two women. The 11 Directors-General of UNESCO have come from six regions within the organization: West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1).\n\nTo date, there has been no elected Director-General from the remaining ten regions within UNESCO: Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America.\n\nThe list of the Directors-General of UNESCO since its establishment in 1946 is as follows:[129]\n\nThis is the list of the sessions of the UNESCO General Conference held since 1946:[130]\n\nBiennial elections are held, with 58 elected representatives holding office for four years.\n\nThe UNESCO headquarters is located at Place de Fontenoy in Paris, France. Several architects collaborated on the construction of the headquarters, including Bernard Zehrfuss, Marcel Breuer and Luigi Nervi.[140] It includes a Garden of Peace which was donated by the Government of Japan.[141] This garden was designed by American-Japanese sculptor artist Isamu Noguchi in 1958 and installed by Japanese gardener Toemon Sano. In 1994–1995, in memory of the 50th anniversary of UNESCO, a meditation room was built by Tadao Ando.[142]\n\nUNESCO's field offices across the globe are categorized into four primary office types based upon their function and geographic coverage: cluster offices, national offices, regional bureaus and liaison offices.\n\nThe following list of all UNESCO Field Offices is organized geographically by UNESCO Region and identifies the members states and associate members of UNESCO which are served by each office.[143]\n• Addis Ababa – Liaison Office with the African Union and with the Economic Commission for Africa\n• Brazzaville – National Office to the Republic of the Congo\n• Dakar – Regional Bureau for Education in Africa and Cluster Office for Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Senegal\n• Kinshasa – National Office to the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n• Libreville – Cluster Office for the Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe\n• Nairobi – Regional Bureau for Sciences in Africa and Cluster Office for Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda\n• Beirut – Regional Bureau for Education in the Arab States and Cluster Office to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Palestine\n• Cairo – Regional Bureau for Sciences in the Arab States and Cluster Office for Egypt and Sudan\n• Iraq – National Office for Iraq (currently located in Amman, Jordan)\n• Apia – Cluster Office to Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Tokelau (Associate Member)\n• Bangkok – Regional Bureau for Education in Asia and the Pacific and Cluster Office to Thailand, Burma, Laos, Singapore and Vietnam\n• Beijing – Cluster Office to North Korea, Japan, Mongolia, the People's Republic of China and South Korea\n• Jakarta – Regional Bureau for Sciences in Asia and the Pacific and Cluster Office to the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and East Timor\n• New Delhi – Cluster Office to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives and Sri Lanka\n• Brussels – Liaison Office to the European Union and its subsidiary bodies in Brussels\n• Geneva – Liaison Office to the United Nations in Geneva\n• New York City – Liaison Office to the United Nations in New York\n• Venice – Regional Bureau for Sciences and Culture in Europe\n• Havana – Regional Bureau for Culture in Latin America and the Caribbean and Cluster Office to Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Aruba\n• Kingston – Cluster Office to Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago as well as the associate member states of British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Curaçao and Sint Maarten\n• Montevideo – Regional Bureau for Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean and Cluster Office to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay\n• Santiago de Chile – Regional Bureau for Education in Latin America and the Caribbean and National Office to Chile\n\nUNESCO has been the centre of controversy in the past, particularly in its relationships with the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the former Soviet Union. During the 1970s and 1980s, UNESCO's support for a \"New World Information and Communication Order\" and its MacBride report calling for democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was condemned in these countries as attempts to curb freedom of the press. UNESCO was perceived as a platform for communists and Third World dictators to attack the West, in contrast to accusations made by the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s.[147] In 1984, the United States withheld its contributions and withdrew from the organization in protest, followed by the United Kingdom in 1985.[148] Singapore withdrew also at the end of 1985, citing rising membership fees.[149] Following a change of government in 1997, the UK rejoined. The United States rejoined in 2003, followed by Singapore on 8 October 2007.[150]\n\nUNESCO has been criticized as being used by the People's Republic of China to present a Chinese Communist Party version of history and to dilute the contributions of ethnic minorities in China such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.[151][152][153]\n\nIsrael was admitted to UNESCO in 1949, one year after its creation. Israel has maintained its membership since then. In 2010, Israel designated the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem – both in the West Bank – as National Heritage Sites and announced restoration work, prompting criticism from the Obama administration and protests from Palestinians.[154] In October 2010, UNESCO's executive board voted to declare the sites as \"al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs\" and \"Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb\" and stated that they were \"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian Territories\" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of international law.[155] UNESCO described the sites as significant to \"people of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions\", and accused Israel of highlighting only the Jewish character of the sites.[156] Israel in turn accused UNESCO of \"detach[ing] the Nation of Israel from its heritage\", and accused it of being politically motivated.[157] The Rabbi of the Western Wall said that Rachel's tomb had not previously been declared a holy Muslim site.[158] Israel partially suspended ties with UNESCO. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon declared that the resolution was a \"part of Palestinian escalation\". Zevulun Orlev, chairman of the Knesset Education and Culture Committee, referred to the resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of UNESCO as a scientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the world.[159][160]\n\nOn 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at Jordan's insistence, censured[clarification needed] Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the Mughrabi Gate Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that Jordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement, saying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to address the UNESCO committee over objections from Egypt.[161]\n\nIn January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova, \"indefinitely postponed\" and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre entitled \"The People, The Book, The Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel\". The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January in Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at UNESCO argued that its display would \"harm the peace process\".[162] The author of the exhibition, professor Robert Wistrich of the Hebrew University's Vidal Sassoon International Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism, called the cancellation an \"appalling act\", and characterized Bokova's decision as \"an arbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people and its history\". UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.[163]\n\nOn 1 January 2019, Israel formally left UNESCO in pursuance of the US withdrawal over perceived continuous anti-Israel bias.[164]\n\nOn 13 October 2016, UNESCO passed a resolution on East Jerusalem that condemned Israel for \"aggressions\" by Israeli police and soldiers and \"illegal measures\" against the freedom of worship and Muslims' access to their holy sites, while also recognizing Israel as the occupying power. Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision.[165] While the text acknowledged the \"importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions\", it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its Muslim name \"Al-Haram al-Sharif\", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary. In response, Israel denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words \"Temple Mount\" or \"Har HaBayit\", stating that it denies Jewish ties to the key holy site.[165][166] After receiving criticism from numerous Israeli politicians and diplomats, including Benjamin Netanyahu and Ayelet Shaked, Israel froze all ties with the organization.[167][168] The resolution was condemned by Ban Ki-moon and the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who said that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and \"to deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site.[169][170] \"Al-Aqsa Mosque [or] Al-Haram al-Sharif\" is also Temple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism.\"[171] It was also rejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a \"hateful anti-Israel sentiment\",[172] and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over Italy's abstention.[172] On 26 October, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the resolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous \"refusal to let the body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their conservation status\".[173] Despite containing some softening of language following Israeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the text.[174] The resolution refers to the site Jews and Christians refer to as the Temple Mount, or Har HaBayit in Hebrew, only by its Arab name – a significant semantic decision also adopted by UNESCO's executive board, triggering condemnation from Israel and its allies. U.S. Ambassador Crystal Nix Hines stated: \"This item should have been defeated. These politicized and one-sided resolutions are damaging the credibility of UNESCO.\"[175]\n\nIn October 2017, the United States and Israel announced they would withdraw from the organization, citing in-part anti-Israel bias.[176][177]\n\nIn February 2011, an article was published in a Palestinian youth magazine in which a teenage girl described one of her four role models as Adolf Hitler. In December 2011, UNESCO, which partly funded the magazine, condemned the material and subsequently withdrew support.[178]\n\nIn 2012, UNESCO decided to establish a chair at the Islamic University of Gaza in the field of astronomy, astrophysics, and space sciences,[179] fueling controversy and criticism. Israel bombed the school in 2008 stating that they develop and store weapons there, which Israel restated in criticizing UNESCO's move.[180][181]\n\nThe head, Kamalain Shaath, defended UNESCO, stating that \"the Islamic University is a purely academic university that is interested only in education and its development\".[182][183][184] Israeli ambassador to UNESCO Nimrod Barkan planned to submit a letter of protest with information about the university's ties to Hamas, especially angry that this was the first Palestinian university that UNESCO chose to cooperate with.[185] The Jewish organization B'nai B'rith criticized the move as well.[186]\n\nIn 2015, Japan threatened to halt funding of UNESCO because of the organization's decision to include documents related to the 1937 Nanjing massacre in the latest listing for its \"Memory of the World\" program.[187] In October 2016, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida confirmed that Japan's 2016 annual funding of ¥4.4 billion had been suspended, although he denied any direct link with the Nanjing document controversy.[188]\n\nThe United States withdrew from UNESCO in 1984, citing the \"highly politicized\" nature of the organization, its ostensible \"hostility toward the basic institutions of a free society, especially a free market and a free press\", as well as its \"unrestrained budgetary expansion\", and poor management under then Director-General Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal.[189]\n\nOn 19 September 1989, US Congressman Jim Leach stated before a congressional subcommittee:[190]\n\nLeach concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world information order, money management, and arms control policy to be the impetuses behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before departing from UNESCO, a withdrawal from the IAEA had been pushed on him.[190] On 1 October 2003, the United States rejoined UNESCO.[189]\n\nOn 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO it would again withdraw from the organization, on 31 December 2018; Israel followed suit.[191] The Department of State cited \"mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO\".[176]\n\nThe United States has not paid over $600 million in dues[192] since it stopped paying its $80 million annual UNESCO dues when Palestine became a full member in 2011. Israel and the United States were among the 14 votes against the membership out of 194 member countries.[193] When the United States announced it was rejoining the body in 2023, it also pledged to pay all past-due payments.[65]\n\nOn 25 May 2016, Turkish poet and human rights activist Zülfü Livaneli resigned as Turkey's only UNESCO goodwill ambassador. He highlighted the human rights situation in Turkey and the destruction of the historical Sur district of Diyarbakir, the largest city in Kurdish-majority southeast Turkey, during fighting between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants as the main reasons for his resignation. Livaneli said: \"To pontificate on peace while remaining silent against such violations is a contradiction of the fundamental ideals of UNESCO.\"[194]\n\nIn 2020 UNESCO stated that the size of the illicit trade in cultural property amounted to 10 billion dollars a year. A report that same year by the Rand Organization suggested the actual market is \"not likely to be larger than a few hundred million dollars each year\". An expert cited by UNESCO as attributing the 10 billion figure denied it, saying he had \"no idea\" where the figure came from. Art dealers were particularly critical of the UNESCO figure because it amounted to 15% of the total world art market.[195]\n\nIn November 2020, part of a UNESCO advertising campaign intended to highlight international trafficking in looted artefacts had to be withdrawn after it falsely presented a series of museum-held artworks with known provenances as recently looted objects held in private collections. The adverts claimed that a head of Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum's collection since 1930 had been looted from a Kabul Museum in 2001 and then smuggled into the US art market, that a funerary monument from Palmyra that the Met had acquired in 1901 had been recently looted from the Palmyra Museum by Islamic State militants and then smuggled into the European antiquities market, and that an Ivory Coast mask with a provenance that indicates it was in the United States by 1954 was looted during armed clashes in 2010–2011. After complaints by the Met, the adverts were withdrawn.[196]\n• UNESDOC Database 197 – Contains more than 146,000 UNESCO documents in full text published since 1945 as well as metadata from the collections of the UNESCO Library and documentation centres in field offices and institutes.\n\nUNESCO develops, maintains, and disseminates, free of charge, two interrelated software packages for database management (CDS/ISIS [not to be confused with UK police software package ISIS]) and data mining/statistical analysis (IDAMS).[198]\n• CDS/ISIS – a generalized information storage and retrieval system.

It was declared a national park in 1981 and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986. It occupies 40 km2 (15 sq mi) and it extends into each of the six municipalities on the island.\n\nNearly 450,000 tourists visit the park every year. There is accommodation for tourists just outside the park's boundary.[1]\n\nThe park is named after the rock formation of Garajonay, the highest point on the island at 1,487 metres (4,879 ft). It also includes a small plateau whose altitude is 790–1,400 metres (2,590–4,590 ft) above sea level. Features of the national park include the massive rocks that are found along the island. These are former volcanoes whose shapes have been carved by erosion. Some, like the \"Fortaleza\" (fortress in Spanish) were considered sacred by the native islanders, as well as ideal refuges when attacked.[2] The park is crossed by a large network of 18 footpaths, trekking being one of the main tourist activities in the island.\n\nMany of the species of flora and fauna are endemic to the Macaronesian islands, the Canary Islands or La Gomera, and the Garajonay forest harbors a rich biota of understory plants, invertebrates, and birds and bats, including a large number of endemic species. The park provides the best example of Canarian laurisilva, a humid subtropical forest that in the Tertiary covered almost all of Southern Europe. It is also found on the Azores and the Madeira Islands. Laurus azorica, known as Azores laurel, or by the Portuguese names louro, loureiro, louro-da-terra, and louro-de-cheiro, can be found in the park, as well as Laurus novocanariensis, known as Canary laurel. Although named as a single type of forest, the national park englobes several varieties of forests. Most humid and protected valleys oriented to the North have the richest and most complex forests. It is known as valley laurisilva, a true subtropical rainforest where the largest laurel trees can be found. At higher altitudes, with less protection from wind and sun, the forest loses some of its more delicate species. Here it is called slope laurisilva (laurisilva de ladera). At the south the forest is mainly a mix of beech and heather, species adapted to the less humid atmosphere. In August 2012, a forest fire burned 747 hectares (18%) of this national park.[3]\n\nTwo species of reptile, Gallotia gomerana (Gomeran lizard) and Chalcides viridanus (Gomeran skink), can be found. Amphibians include the stripeless tree frog, Hyla meridionalis. The park is renowned as one of the best places to observe the two Canarian endemic pigeons, laurel pigeon (Columba junoniae) and Bolle's pigeon (Columba bollii). The park has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of various birds. As well as the two endemic pigeon species, these include Barbary partridges, plain swifts, Eurasian sparrowhawks, Berthelot's pipits and island canaries.[4]\n\nThe peak and park are named after Guanche lore, the hapless lovers Gara and Jonay. Their romance evokes those of Romeo and Juliet and Hero and Leander. Gara was a princess of Agulo on La Gomera. During the festival of Beñesmén, it was customary for unmarried girls of Agulo to gaze at their reflections in the waters of Chorros del Epina. If the water was clear, they would find a husband; if it was cloudy, some misfortune would befall them. When Gara looked at the water, she saw her reflection clearly. However, she gazed too long and the sun's reflection blinded her temporarily. A wise man named Gerián told her that this meant that she needed to avoid all fire or else it would consume her.\n\nJonay was the son of the Guanche mencey or king of Adeje on Tenerife, who arrived on the island to celebrate these ceremonies. Jonay's participation in the ensuing games attracted the attention of Gara, and the two fell in love. Unfortunately, when the engagement was announced, the volcano Teide, visible from La Gomera, began to erupt as if in disapproval. This was interpreted as a bad omen and the couple’s respective parents broke the engagement. Jonay was made to return to Tenerife, but one night, he swam across the channel that separated the two islands and rejoined his beloved. Their respective fathers ordered that the two be found. The lovers were soon trapped on a mountain, where they decided to take their own lives.\n• The park's wooden statues of Gara and Jonay\n• Guanche Sanctuary in the summit of Garajonay mountain.Parque Nacional de Garajonay: Introducción general al uso de cookies en el portal MITECO.gob.es\n\nLas cookies son archivos que se pueden descargar en su equipo a través de las páginas web.

Protege un bosque emblemático de nuestro país: la laurisilva o Monteverde. Un ecosistema que nos llega del Terciario, con una flora superviviente de las selvas subtropicales que poblaron la cuenca mediterránea hace millones de años\n\nSu declaración como Parque Nacional en 1981 y Patrimonio Mundial por la UNESCO 5 años más tarde, reconocen el valor del Monteverde canario como uno de los bosques más antiguos de Europa. Frecuentes nieblas traídas por los vientos alisios han permitido su existencia, inimaginable sin la presencia casi permanente de la humedad aportada por las nubes. La llamada lluvia horizontal empapa las hojas perennes de forma similar a la del laurel, que dan el nombre de laurisilva a este singular bosque-esponja. Garajonay se extiende entre los 800 y los 1.487 m de altitud, donde se halla la máxima altura de la isla.\n\nDe origen volcánico, la ausencia de actividad eruptiva en La Gomera durante los últimos 2 millones de años, y un clima que propicia la erosión, han creado un relieve surcado por profundos barrancos. En ellos se refugia un gran número de especies endémicas de flora y fauna, y sobresalen los espectaculares Roques, que apenas interrumpen el denso y verde manto vegetal.\n\nLa pregunta que se hacen muchos visitantes de Garajonay es porqué no hay animales grandes. La respuesta es que la fauna nativa de las islas está limitada por el aislamiento del continente, que impide la colonización de estos animales. Por ello, la fauna vertebrada se limita a aves y murciélagos, que con su capacidad de vuelo si pudieron llegar hasta aquí. Las aves son, por lo tanto, los vertebrados más numerosos. Un total de 28 especies de aves crían en Garajonay. Es frecuente escuchar y ver al mirlo común entre la espesura, y avistar de forma fugaz a pinzones, mosquiteros, herrerillos y reyezuelos. Pero de todas las especies de aves de Garajonay, las más representativas son las palomas endémicas de Canarias, las palomas turqué y rabiche, que se alimentan de los frutos de los árboles del bosque. Sin embargo, la gran riqueza faunística de Garajonay está sobre todo en la fauna invertebrada, que tiene un elevado número de endemismos.\n\nLa Gomera, a diferencia de las restantes islas de Canarias, es una isla sin actividad volcánica reciente, caracterizada por profundos barrancos excavados por la erosión. En sus cumbres se conserva un extraordinario bosque de laurisilva, incluido en su mayor parte en el Parque Nacional de Garajonay, cuya frondosidad contrasta con la aridez dominante en el resto de la isla. La laurisilva es una reliquia de la Era Terciaria, que conserva parte de la flora que entonces ocupaba buena parte de Europa, y que desapareció del continente tras profundos cambios en el clima, que afectaron en menor medida a las Islas Canarias. Hoy es un ecosistema propio de la llamada Región Macaronésica, que incluye, junto con las islas Canarias, a Madeira, Azores y Cabo Verde, aunque en este último Archipiélago, la laurisilva está ausente. La Laurisilva es excepcional en su ámbito geográfico, pues los bosques que se les asemejan se encuentran en áreas muy alejadas del Planeta, en el sureste asiático o las montañas del trópico húmedo.\n\nEn las áreas más lluviosas del Parque, las precipitaciones superan los 900 mm anuales, propiciando un paisaje de bosques densos surcado por pequeñas y grandes caídas de agua y riachuelos que descienden hacia los fondos de valle. Uno de los cursos de agua más conocidos de Garajonay es el barranco del Cedro. La laurisilva es crucial como productora de agua en una isla de características áridas. Su capacidad para retener y almacenar agua al paso de las masas de aire con humedad, es fundamental para la recarga hidrológica. Ello explica que por el Parque Nacional fluya la red de corrientes de agua permanente más amplia y mejor conservada de Canarias.\n\nDentro del conjunto forestal de Garajonay, destacan unos afloramientos de rocas modelados por la erosión: los roques y fortalezas. Son domos volcánicos de escarpadas paredes rocosas, los primeros de base estrecha y puntiagudos, y los segundos en forma de meseta. Se trata del relleno de antiguos conductos volcánicos puestos en resalte por la erosión durante millones de años de los materiales circundantes más erosionables. En estos lugares encuentran refugio numerosas especies vegetales rupícolas, muchas de ellas endémicas. Entre los roques destacan los de Agando, Ojila, La Zarcita y Carmona, y entre las fortalezas la de Chipude, próxima al Parque, y la de Cherelepin. Podemos observar estos monumentos geológicos muy de cerca desde algunos miradores ubicados en la carretera que atraviesa el Parque Nacional.\n\nAntes de la llegada de los europeos en el siglo XV, La Gomera estaba habitada y dividida en cuatro cantones, ubicados en los cuatro grandes barrancos de la isla. Sus pobladores procedían del norte de África. Del bosque obtenían carbón, leña y, sobre todo, agua. Su economía se basaba en la ganadería y la recolección y habitaban en cuevas o en pequeñas cabañas. Se han encontrados restos arqueológicos ligados a la celebración de sus rituales.\n\nDesde su colonización en el siglo XV, se convierte en parada obligada para las rutas hacia las recién descubiertas tierras americanas. Cristóbal Colón recaló en su costa en varias ocasiones. Un régimen feudal aísla La Gomera prácticamente hasta el siglo XIX. Durante esos años, se establece una normativa de uso para la obtención de rentas que evita la degradación del bosque.\n\nA mediados del siglo XX se elimina el ganado del monte y se reducen los aprovechamientos forestales. Los avatares históricos, junto con la iniciativa conservacionista de la población local, han permitido la supervivencia de árboles centenarios que podemos contemplar en pleno siglo XXI.\n\nUna de las manifestaciones antropológicas más singulares de la Gomera es una original y exclusiva forma de comunicación, conocida como silbo gomero, que sólo existe en la isla. Su origen procede de la dificultad de los antiguos pobladores para comunicarse debido al accidentado relieve de la Gomera.\n\nEn 2009 fue declarado por la UNESCO Patrimonio Inmaterial de la Humanidad.Patrimonio de la Humanidad - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Patrimonio Mundial, más conocido como Patrimonio de la Humanidad, es el título conferido por la Unesco a sitios específicos del planeta (sean bosque, montaña, lago, laguna, cueva, desierto, edificación, complejo arquitectónico, ruta cultural, paisaje cultural o ciudad) que han sido propuestos y confirmados para su inclusión en la lista mantenida por el programa Patrimonio Mundial, administrado por el Comité del Patrimonio Mundial, compuesto por 21 Estados miembros a los que elige la Asamblea General de Estados miembros por un periodo determinado.[1]​\n\nEl objetivo del programa es catalogar, preservar y dar a conocer sitios de importancia cultural o natural excepcional para la herencia común de la humanidad. Bajo ciertas condiciones, los sitios mencionados pueden obtener financiación para su conservación del Fondo para la conservación del Patrimonio mundial. Fue fundado por la Convención para la cooperación internacional en la protección de la herencia cultural y natural de la humanidad, que posteriormente fue adoptada por la conferencia general de la Unesco el 16 de noviembre de 1972. Desde entonces, 193 Estados miembros han ratificado la convención.\n\nPara julio de 2024, el catálogo consta de un total de 1223 sitios del Patrimonio Mundial, de los cuales 952 son culturales, 231 naturales y 40 mixtos, distribuidos en 168 países.[2]​Por cantidad de sitios inscritos, los diez primeros países son: Italia (60 sitios), China (59 sitios), Alemania (54 sitios), Francia (53 sitios), España (50 sitios), India (43 sitios), México y Reino Unido (ambos con 35 sitios), Rusia (32 sitios) e Irán (28 sitios).[3]​ Algunas de las regiones subnacionales con más bienes culturales Patrimonio Mundial son Castilla y León y Andalucía (España), con 8; junto con las regiones de la Toscana, la Lombardía y el Véneto (Italia), las tres con 8 o más bienes.[4]​[5]​[6]​\n\nHistóricamente, la inscripción de los dos primeros bienes registrados en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial en 1978, el centro histórico de Quito y las islas Galápagos, ambas ubicadas en Ecuador, se celebra cada 3 de diciembre en la Sede de la Unesco en París. Las islas Galápagos poseen la distinción de ser el primer bien natural declarado Patrimonio Mundial, mientras que el centro histórico de Quito, junto con el de Cracovia (Polonia), fueron los primeros centros históricos inscritos en la Lista.[7]​[8]​\n\nLa Unesco se refiere a cada sitio con un número de identificación único, pero las nuevas inscripciones incluyen a menudo los sitios anteriores ahora enumerados como parte de descripciones más grandes. Consecuentemente, el sistema de numeración termina actualmente sobre 1500, aunque realmente haya 1092 catalogados; con el añadido de que muchos de los Patrimonios de la Humanidad se encuentran en múltiples ubicaciones, siendo el mismo sitio, principalmente aquellos que son rutas culturales, conjuntos de un mismo concepto de sitio natural protegido, o paisajes culturales.\n\nCada sitio Patrimonio Mundial pertenece al país en el que se localiza, pero se considera en el interés de la comunidad internacional y debe ser preservado para las futuras generaciones. La protección y la conservación de estos sitios son una preocupación de los 122 Estados miembros de la Unesco.\n\nEn 1959, el gobierno de Egipto decidió construir la presa de Asuán, lo que generaría la inundación del valle en el que se encontraban tesoros de enorme valor arqueológico e histórico como los templos de Abu Simbel. Entonces la Unesco lanzó una campaña internacional de protección de estos tesoros. Los templos de Abu Simbel y de File fueron desmontados, transportados a un sitio más alto y reconstruidos con exactitud pieza por pieza.\n\nEl costo del proyecto fue de aproximadamente 80 millones de dólares estadounidenses, de los cuales casi la mitad fue obtenida de 50 países. Se consideró ampliamente un éxito y esto llevó al desarrollo de nuevas campañas de protección, como la de salvar Venecia y su laguna, las ruinas de Mohenjo-Daro en Pakistán o el templo Borobudur en Indonesia. La Unesco propugnó así, junto con el Consejo Internacional de Monumentos y Sitios, una convención para proteger el patrimonio cultural común de la humanidad.\n\nLos Estados Unidos iniciaron la idea de combinar la conservación cultural con la conservación natural. En una conferencia de la Casa Blanca en 1965 se pidió por una \"entidad para el patrimonio de la humanidad\" para preservar \"las áreas naturales y sitios históricos del mundo para el presente y futuro de toda la humanidad\". En 1968 la Unión Mundial para la Conservación desarrolló propuestas similares, que fueron presentadas en 1972 en una conferencia de Naciones Unidas sobre ambiente humano en Estocolmo, Suecia.\n\nUn solo texto fue aprobado por todas las partes, y la Convención sobre la Protección del Patrimonio Mundial Cultural y Natural fue adoptada por la Conferencia General de la Unesco en su XVII reunión celebrada en París el 16 de noviembre de 1972.\n\nEl Comité del Patrimonio Mundial se reúne una vez al año, y se compone de representantes de 21 de los Estados Partes elegidos por la Asamblea General. En su primera sesión, el Comité aprobó su Reglamento Interno del Comité del Patrimonio Mundial. Este Comité de 21 miembros, es responsable de la aplicación de la Convención del Patrimonio Mundial, define el uso del Fondo del Patrimonio Mundial y asigna ayuda financiera a petición de los Estados. Tiene la última palabra sobre si una propiedad estará inscrita en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial. Examina los informes sobre el estado de conservación de los bienes inscritos y pide la toma de medidas correspondientes a los países cuando los sitios inscritos no están siendo manejados adecuadamente. También decide sobre la inscripción o supresión de bienes en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial en Peligro.[9]​\n\nEn 2021, los 21 miembros del Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad, son:\n\nEl Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad se reúne varias veces al año para discutir medidas sobre la gestión de los sitios Patrimonio de la Humanidad existentes, y aceptar las candidaturas de los países interesados. En una sesión anual, conocida como la Sesión del Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad, es donde los sitios son oficialmente inscritos en la lista de Patrimonio de la Humanidad, luego de presentaciones hechas por la UMC o el CIMS, y deliberaciones de los Estados miembros. La sesión anual se celebra en ciudades alrededor del mundo. Con la excepción de aquellas celebradas en París, donde se ubica la sede central de la Unesco, solo los Estados miembros del Comité tienen derecho a celebrar una sesión futura del Comité en su territorio, previa aprobación del Comité.[1]​\n\nDesde 1977 hasta 2024, el Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad ha celebrado 46 sesiones ordinarias y diez sesiones extraordinarias.\n\nEl proceso comienza cuando un país desarrolla un inventario con todos sus sitios con características naturales o culturales significativas para ser incluidos en la Lista Provisional,[10]​ y es importante porque un país no puede nominar un sitio que no haya estado incluido en esta. A continuación, puede seleccionar un sitio de esta lista para ubicarla en un Expediente de Candidatura. El Centro del Patrimonio de la Humanidad ofrece ayuda en la confección de este expediente, el cual debe ser lo más completo posible.\n\nPosteriormente el expediente es evaluado independientemente por dos organizaciones: La Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN) y el Consejo Internacional de Monumentos y Sitios (ICOMOS, por sus siglas en inglés). Estas entidades elevan después sus recomendaciones al Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad. El Comité se reúne una vez al año para determinar si incluir o no cada sitio candidato en la lista definitiva, y a veces aplaza su decisión para solicitar más información a los Estados miembros. Hay diez criterios que un sitio debe cumplir, en uno o más puntos, para ser incluido en la lista.\n\nA finales de 2004, había un grupo de seis criterios en el ámbito cultural y otros cuatro en el ámbito natural. En 2005, esto se modificó y se unieron para que hubiera un único grupo de diez criterios (los 6 primeros para bienes culturales y los 4 últimos para bienes naturales). Para ser incluido en la lista del Patrimonio de la Humanidad, un sitio debe tener un \"valor universal excepcional\" y debe satisfacer al menos uno de los siguientes criterios de selección:[11]​\n\nDesde 1992 la interacción entre el hombre y el medio ambiente es reconocido como paisaje cultural.\n\nHasta julio de 2019 existen 1121 sitios declarados Patrimonio Mundial en 167 Estados miembros. De estos, 869 son culturales, 213 naturales y 39 son mixtos. De estos, 37 se consideran transfronterizos, lo que significa que pertenecen a más de 1 país.\n\nLa Unesco ha establecido una clasificación geográfica de los sitios declarados Patrimonio de la Humanidad en la que distingue cinco áreas: África (no incluye los países de los Estados árabes), América Latina y el Caribe[12]​ (incluye a Isla de Pascua), Asia y Oceanía (no incluye los Estados árabes),[13]​Estados árabes (incluye además una zona de Jerusalén propuesta por Jordania),[14]​y Europa y América del Norte (no incluye a México; este grupo incluye a Israel, Turquía, Rusia y Hawái).[15]​\n\nLos zonas geográficas de la Unesco dan, además, mayor énfasis en lo administrativo que a las asociaciones geográficas. Por ejemplo Israel, que geográficamente está ubicado en Asia, pero está dentro de la clasificación como parte del grupo de Europa y América del Norte, así como la isla de Pascua geográficamente ubicada en Oceanía, pero que forma parte de la región América Latina y el Caribe, ya que la isla es parte de Chile.\n\nLa siguiente lista muestra a aquellos países que presentan 10 o más Patrimonios de la Humanidad, hasta septiembre de 2023. Estos 32 países representan más de la mitad de los sitios nombrados.\n\nDe entre todos los sitios existentes, algunos se sitúan además en la lista de Patrimonios de la Humanidad en peligro, al estar amenazados por conflictos, catástrofes naturales, o el deterioro del medio ambiente por el ser humano. 53 sitios se encuentran en la categoría \"Patrimonio de la Humanidad en peligro\" (17 naturales y 36 culturales), siendo los países con mayor cantidad de estos Siria (6 sitios en peligro), Libia (5 sitios), República Democrática del Congo (5 sitios), Irak (3 sitios), Malí (3 sitios), Palestina (3 sitios) y Yemen (3 sitios).\n\nSolo tres Patrimonios de la Humanidad han sido retirados de las listas por considerarse que habían sido desprotegidos por los países donde se encontraban.\n\nLa distinción de Patrimonio de la Humanidad ha recibido críticas desde distintas perspectivas. Una de ellas es el impacto adverso del turismo de masas en sitios que no pueden gestionar el rápido crecimiento del número de visitantes.[16]​\n• Portal:Patrimonio de la Humanidad.

UU.; en inglés: United States o US),[nota 3]​ denominado oficialmente Estados Unidos de América (EUA; en inglés: United States of America o USA)[13]​ es un país soberano constituido en una república federal constitucional compuesta por cincuenta estados y un distrito federal. Limita al norte con Canadá y al sur, con México. Su capital es Washington D. C. y su ciudad más poblada, Nueva York. La mayor parte del país se ubica en el medio de América del Norte ―donde se encuentran sus 48 estados contiguos y Washington D. C.―, entre los océanos Pacífico y Atlántico.\n\nEl estado de Alaska está en el noroeste del continente, limita con Canadá al este, separado de Rusia al oeste por el estrecho de Bering. El estado de Hawái es un archipiélago polinesio ubicado en Oceanía, en medio del océano Pacífico y es el único de sus estados que no se encuentra en América.\n\nEl país posee en el mar Caribe dos territorios no incorporados, el estado libre asociado de Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes, en el Pacífico otros territorios no incorporados, y a diferencia de estos últimos, un «territorio incorporado no organizado»: el atolón Palmyra.\n\nCon 9.83 millones de kilómetros cuadrados,[5]​ y con más de 340 millones de habitantes, el país está en el cuarto puesto por superficie total, en el quinto por superficie contigua y en el tercer por población. Es una de las naciones con más diversidad de etnias y culturas, producto de la inmigración a gran escala.[14]​\n\nEs la economía nacional más grande del mundo en términos nominales, con un PIB estimado en 22.6 billones de dólares (una cuarta parte del PIB global nominal) y una quinta parte del PIB global en paridad de poder adquisitivo.[9]​ El país es la principal fuerza capitalista del planeta, además de ser líder en la investigación científica y la innovación tecnológica desde el siglo XIX y, desde comienzos del siglo XX, el principal país industrial. En PIB PPA, Estados Unidos es la segunda economía más grande, por detrás de la China.[15]​\n\nEl territorio continental estadounidense estuvo habitado por diversos grupos indígenas durante miles de años. Esta población aborigen fue reducida por las enfermedades y la guerra, después del primer contacto con los europeos. Estados Unidos fue fundado por trece colonias británicas, a lo largo de la costa atlántica. El 4 de julio de 1776, emitieron la Declaración de Independencia, que proclamó su derecho a la libre autodeterminación y el establecimiento de una unión cooperativa. Los estados rebeldes derrotaron al Imperio británico en la guerra de independencia, el primer conflicto bélico colonial exitoso de carácter independentista. ​ La Constitución de los Estados Unidos fue adoptada el 17 de septiembre de 1787; su ratificación al año siguiente hizo a los estados parte de una sola república con un gobierno central fuerte. La Carta de Derechos, que comprende diez enmiendas constitucionales que garantizan muchos derechos civiles fundamentales y las libertades, fue ratificada en 1791.\n\nEn el siglo XIX, los Estados Unidos adquirieron territorios de Francia, España, Reino Unido, México, Rusia y Japón, además de anexionarse las repúblicas de Florida, Texas, California y Hawái. En la década de 1860, las disputas entre el sur agrario y conservador y el norte industrial y progresista sobre los derechos de los estados y la abolición de la esclavitud provocaron la Guerra de Secesión. La victoria del norte evitó una división permanente del país y condujo al final de la esclavitud legal. Para la década de 1890, la economía nacional era la más grande del mundo[17]​ y la guerra hispano-estadounidense y la Primera Guerra Mundial confirmaron su estatus como una potencia militar. Después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, surgió como el primer país con armas nucleares y miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas.\n\nDurante la Guerra Fría, Estados Unidos luchó en la guerra de Corea y la guerra de Vietnam, pero evitó el conflicto militar directo con la Unión Soviética. Las dos superpotencias compitieron en la Carrera Espacial, que culminó en el vuelo espacial de 1969 que llevó a los humanos a la Luna por primera vez. El final de la Guerra Fría y la disolución de la URSS la dejaron como la única superpotencia internacional. En el siglo XXI, los atentados del 11-S dieron lugar a la denominada guerra contra el terrorismo, y el ascenso de China y el regreso de Rusia conducen a una Nueva Guerra Fría, mientras que eventos como la crisis económica de 2008, la elección de Donald Trump como presidente en 2016 o las protestas por la muerte de George Floyd en 2020 provocaron tensiones sociales internas.\n\nEl país representa dos quintas partes del gasto militar mundial y es una fuerza económica, política y cultural, líder en el mundo.[18]​[19]​\n\nEn 1507, el cartógrafo alemán Martin Waldseemüller elaboró un planisferio en el que llamó a las tierras del hemisferio occidental «América», en honor al explorador y cartógrafo italiano Américo Vespucio.[20]​ Las antiguas colonias británicas utilizaron por primera vez el nombre del país moderno en la Declaración de Independencia, la «unánime declaración de los trece Estados Unidos de la América» adoptada por los «representantes de los Estados Unidos de América», 4 de julio de 1776.[21]​ El nombre actual se determinó el 15 de noviembre de 1777, cuando el Segundo Congreso Continental aprobó los Artículos de la Confederación, que estipulan, «El nombre de esta Confederación será “Los Estados Unidos de América”». «Columbia», un nombre una vez popular para los Estados Unidos, se deriva del nombre de Cristóbal Colón y aún permanece en el nombre del distrito de Columbia. Ocasionalmente se le llama, de forma incorrecta, «Estados Unidos de Norteamérica», derivando en una confusión en su gentilicio.\n\nLa manera estándar para referirse a un ciudadano de los Estados Unidos son los términos estadounidense (o estadunidense en Honduras y México).[13]​ También se utilizan gringo y yanqui, que pueden o no tener un matiz despectivo, según el uso, el contexto y el tono de la voz.[22]​ A veces se utiliza «norteamericano» como sinónimo de «estadounidense», pero se debe tener presente que la región de Norteamérica está formada por Canadá, Estados Unidos y la mayor parte de México, hasta el istmo de Tehuantepec. Debe evitarse el gentilicio «americano» para referirse exclusivamente a los naturales de los Estados Unidos[13]​ debido a que esta palabra engloba a todos los habitantes del continente americano. Por esta razón, el gentilicio recomendado es la palabra «estadounidense». Para escribir abreviadamente el nombre de este país suelen emplearse, de manera correcta, la abreviatura «EE. UU.» (Estados Unidos),[23]​ o la sigla «EUA» (Estados Unidos de América). Aunque frecuente, en español es incorrecto emplear la sigla anglosajona «USA».[13]​\n\nComúnmente se piensa que los pueblos indígenas de los Estados Unidos continentales, incluyendo a los nativos de Alaska, emigraron desde Asia entre doce mil y cuarenta mil años atrás.[24]​ Algunos, tales como la cultura misisipiana, desarrollaron una agricultura avanzada, grandes obras arquitectónicas y sociedades con un orden jerárquico. Después de que los europeos comenzaran a asentarse en América, hubo una acusada disminución de la población indígena debido a las epidemias de enfermedades traídas desde Europa, como la viruela.[25]​\n\nEn 1492, el navegante Cristóbal Colón, en su proyecto de circunnavegar hasta Asia, patrocinado por la Corona Española, llegó desde España hasta las islas del Caribe, realizando el primer contacto con los pueblos indígenas del Nuevo Mundo. El 2 de abril de 1513, el conquistador español Juan Ponce de León desembarcó en lo que llamó La Florida, siendo la primera llegada europea documentada en el territorio estadounidense. Los asentamientos españoles en la región fueron seguidos por otros en el actual suroeste de Estados Unidos. Los comerciantes de pieles franceses se establecieron en Nueva Francia, alrededor de la zona de los Grandes Lagos; finalmente Francia reclamaría gran parte del interior de Estados Unidos, hasta la costa del golfo de México. Los primeros asentamientos ingleses exitosos fueron la colonia de Virginia en Jamestown en 1607 y la colonia de Plymouth fundada por peregrinos en 1620. En 1628, el establecimiento de la provincia de la bahía de Massachusetts dio lugar a una nueva ola de inmigración: para 1634, Nueva Inglaterra estaba habitada por cerca de diez mil puritanos. Entre la década de 1610 y la guerra de independencia, cerca de cincuenta mil convictos fueron enviados desde el Viejo Continente hacia las colonias.[26]​ Desde 1614, los neerlandeses se establecieron a lo largo del río Hudson inferior, fundando Nueva Ámsterdam en la isla de Manhattan.\n\nEn 1674, los Países Bajos cedieron su territorio a Inglaterra y la provincia de los Nuevos Países Bajos fue renombrada con el nombre de Nueva York, convertida en la ciudad más importante de los Estados Unidos desde mediados del siglo XIX. Muchos inmigrantes recién llegados, especialmente en el sur, fueron contratados como criados, de tal modo que cerca de dos tercios de todos los inmigrantes que llegaron a Virginia entre 1630 y 1680 trabajaban como sirvientes. ​ Para finales de ese siglo, los esclavos africanos se convirtieron en la principal fuente de mano de obra en condiciones de servidumbre. Con la división de las Carolinas en 1729 y la colonización de Georgia en 1732, se establecieron las Trece Colonias británicas, que finalmente se convertirían en los Estados Unidos de América. Todas contaban con un gobierno local electo, apegado al republicanismo, además de que se legalizó el comercio de esclavos. Con altas tasas de nacimiento, bajas tasas de mortalidad y la constante inmigración, la población colonial creció rápidamente. El movimiento cristiano revivalista de las décadas de 1730 y 1740, conocido como «el Gran Despertar», alimentó el interés en temas como la religión y la libertad de culto. En la guerra franco-india, las fuerzas británicas le arrebataron Canadá a Francia, pero la población de habla francesa permaneció políticamente aislada de las colonias del sur. Sin contar a los nativos americanos (popularmente conocidos como «indios») que finalmente fueron desplazados en contra de su voluntad, en 1770 las Trece colonias tenían una población de 2.6 millones de habitantes, alrededor de una tercera parte de la del Reino Unido, aunque casi uno de cada cinco estadounidenses era un esclavo negro. ​ Sin embargo, los colonos estadounidenses no tenían ninguna representación en el Parlamento del Reino Unido.\n\nLas tensiones entre los colonos y los británicos durante las décadas de 1760 y 1770 condujeron a la Guerra de Independencia, que se extendió desde 1775 hasta 1781. El 14 de junio de 1775, el Congreso Continental, reunido en Filadelfia, estableció un Ejército Continental bajo el mando de George Washington. Proclamando que «todos los hombres nacen iguales» y dotados de «ciertos derechos inalienables», el Congreso aprobó la Declaración de Independencia, redactada en gran parte por Thomas Jefferson, el 4 de julio de 1776.[29]​ Anualmente, en esta fecha se celebra el Día de la Independencia de los Estados Unidos. Así, Estados Unidos se convirtió en la primera nación americana en declarar su independencia. En 1777, los artículos de la Confederación establecieron un débil gobierno confederal, que operó hasta 1789.\n\nDespués de la derrota británica por las fuerzas estadounidenses, asistidas por franceses y españoles, el Reino Unido reconoció su independencia y soberanía sobre el territorio al este del río Misisipi. Una convención constitucional fue organizada en 1787 por aquellos que deseaban establecer un gobierno nacional fuerte. La Constitución de los Estados Unidos fue ratificada en 1788 y un año más tarde, George Washington se convirtió en el primer presidente. La Carta de Derechos, que prohibía la restricción federal de los derechos humanos y garantizaba una serie de medidas para su protección jurídica, fue adoptada en 1791.[30]​\n\nCon la nueva autonomía, las actitudes hacia la esclavitud fueron cambiando; una cláusula en la Constitución protegió el comercio de esclavos hasta 1808. Los estados del norte abolieron la esclavitud entre 1780 y 1804, dejando a los estados esclavistas del sur como defensores de la «institución peculiar». El «Segundo Gran Despertar», que comenzó alrededor de 1800, convirtió a las Iglesias evangélicas en una de las principales fuerzas detrás de varios de los movimientos reformistas de la época, incluyendo el abolicionismo.[31]​\n\nEn 1803, la compra de la Luisiana a Francia durante el mandato del presidente Thomas Jefferson, casi duplicó el tamaño de la nación,[32]​ al mismo tiempo que la guerra anglo-estadounidense de 1812 fortaleció aún más el nacionalismo entre la población. Derrotado por el Reino Unido y tras su segunda y definitiva abdicación al trono francés en 1815, Napoleón Bonaparte intentó escapar a Estados Unidos, entonces rival del Reino Unido, pero fue capturado por las fuerzas británicas y deportado a Santa Helena. En 1819, una serie de incursiones militares en Florida obligó a España a ceder este y otros territorios de la costa del golfo.[32]​ El sendero de lágrimas en la década de 1830 ejemplifica la política de Remoción India que despojó a varios pueblos indígenas de sus tierras. Estados Unidos se anexó la República de Texas en 1845, época durante la cual el concepto del Destino Manifiesto se popularizó. ​ En 1846, la firma del Tratado de Oregón con el Reino Unido, le otorgó al país los actuales territorios del noroeste.[32]​ Dos años más tarde, la victoria en la guerra contra México dio lugar a la cesión de California y la mayor parte del suroeste actual.[32]​ La fiebre del oro de 1848 y 1849 estimuló aún más la migración hacia el oeste y los nuevos ferrocarriles facilitaron la reubicación de los colonos y el aumento de los conflictos con los nativos americanos. Durante medio siglo, hasta 40 millones de bisontes americanos fueron sacrificados por sus pieles y carne para facilitar la propagación de los ferrocarriles. La pérdida de los búfalos, una fuente principal de alimento para los indígenas de las llanuras, fue un golpe mortal para muchas culturas nativas.[34]​\n\nLas tensiones entre estados pro-esclavistas y los abolicionistas, junto al aumento de los desacuerdos en la relación entre el gobierno federal y estatal, provocaron conflictos violentos por causa de la expansión de la esclavitud hacia los nuevos territorios. Abraham Lincoln, candidato del Partido Republicano y un gran abolicionista, fue elegido presidente en 1860. Antes de que tomase posesión de su cargo, seis estados esclavistas declararon su secesión de la Unión, formando los Estados Confederados de América, si bien otros estados también esclavistas permanecieron leales a la Unión.[35]​ El gobierno federal declaró que la secesión era ilegal y pronto se produjo el ataque por parte de los secesionistas a Fort Sumter, iniciándose así la guerra civil estadounidense el 12 de abril de 1861.[36]​\n\nTras la victoria de la Unión el 9 de abril de 1865, se añadieron tres enmiendas a la constitución para garantizar la libertad de los casi 4 millones de afroamericanos que habían sido esclavos, convirtiéndolos en ciudadanos y dándoles el derecho de voto.[37]​ La guerra y su resolución dio lugar a un aumento sustancial de las competencias del gobierno federal. ​\n\nDespués del asesinato de Abraham Lincoln, tuvo lugar la época conocida como la Reconstrucción, en la cual se desarrollaron políticas encaminadas a la reintegración y la reconstrucción de los estados sureños garantizando al mismo tiempo los derechos de los nuevos esclavos liberados. Las controvertidas elecciones presidenciales de 1876 se resolvieron mediante el Compromiso de 1877, por el cual los demócratas sureños reconocieron como presidente a Rutherford B. Hayes a cambio de que este retirara las tropas que aún permanecían desplegadas en Luisiana, Carolina del Sur y Florida. A partir de 1876 empiezan a aplicarse las llamadas leyes de Jim Crow, una política de apartheid que perduraría hasta 1965.[39]​ La Masacre de Wounded Knee en 1890 fue el último conflicto armado en la larga guerra con los pueblos originarios.[40]​\n\nEn el norte, la urbanización sin precedentes y una afluencia de inmigrantes aceleró la industrialización del país. La ola de la inmigración, que duró hasta 1929, proporcionó mano de obra para los negocios, transformado a su vez la cultura. La alta protección arancelaria, la creación de infraestructuras nacionales y los nuevos reglamentos bancarios alentaron el crecimiento industrial. En 1867, se produce la compra de Alaska a Rusia, completando la expansión continental del país.[32]​ La masacre de Wounded Knee en 1890 fue el último gran conflicto armado contra los nativos indios americanos. En 1893, la monarquía indígena del Reino de Hawái fue derrocada en un golpe de Estado liderado por ciudadanos estadounidenses; el archipiélago fue anexado al país en 1898.[32]​ La victoria en la guerra hispano-estadounidense ese mismo año, demostró que Estados Unidos era una potencia mundial y dio lugar a la ocupación de Cuba y la anexión de Puerto Rico y las Filipinas.[41]​ Filipinas accedió a la independencia en 1946, mientras que Puerto Rico continúa siendo un Estado libre asociado.\n\nAl estallar la Primera Guerra Mundial en Europa en 1914, Estados Unidos se declaró neutral. Posteriormente, los estadounidenses se solidarizaron con los británicos y franceses, a pesar de que muchos ciudadanos, sobre todo los originarios de Irlanda y Alemania, se opusieron a la intervención. ​ En 1917 se sumaron a los Aliados, contribuyendo a la derrota de las Potencias Centrales. Reacio a participar en asuntos europeos, el Senado no ratificó el Tratado de Versalles (1919), que estableció la Sociedad de Naciones, aplicando una política de unilateralismo, que rayaba en el aislacionismo. ​ En 1920, el movimiento de los derechos de la mujer ganó la aprobación de una enmienda constitucional para otorgar a las mujeres el sufragio.[30]​\n\nDurante la mayor parte de la década de 1920, el país gozó de un período de prosperidad, disminuyendo el desequilibrio de la balanza de pagos mientras crecían las ganancias de las granjas industriales. Este período, conocido como los felices años veinte, culminó en la crisis de 1929 que desencadenó la Gran Depresión. Después de su elección como presidente en 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt respondió con el New Deal (nuevo trato), una serie de políticas que aumentaron la intervención del gobierno en la economía.[44]​ De 1920 a 1933 se estableció una ley seca conocida como La prohibición.[45]​ La Dust Bowl (cuenca de polvo) de mediados de la década de 1930 dejó varias comunidades de agricultores empobrecidos y estimuló una nueva ola de migración hacia la costa occidental.[46]​\n\nEstados Unidos, oficialmente neutral durante las primeras etapas de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, inició el suministro de provisiones a los Aliados en marzo de 1941, a través del Programa de Préstamo y Arriendo. El 7 de diciembre de 1941, el país se unió a la lucha de los Aliados contra las Potencias del Eje, después del ataque japonés a Pearl Harbor. La Segunda Guerra Mundial impulsó la economía mediante el suministro de capital de inversión y puestos de trabajo, haciendo que muchas mujeres entraran en el mercado laboral. De los principales combatientes, Estados Unidos fue la única nación que se enriqueció a causa de la guerra. ​ Las conferencias en Bretton Woods y Yalta crearon un nuevo sistema de organización internacional que colocó al país y a la Unión Soviética en el centro de los asuntos mundiales. En 1945, cuando llegó el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial en Europa, una conferencia internacional celebrada en San Francisco redactó la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, que entró en vigor después de la guerra.[48]​ Después de haber desarrollado la primera arma nuclear, el gobierno decidió utilizarla en las ciudades japonesas de Hiroshima y Nagasaki en agosto de ese mismo año. Japón se rindió el 2 de septiembre, poniendo fin a la guerra.[49]​\n\nEn la Guerra Fría, Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética compitieron tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, dominando los asuntos militares de Europa a través de la OTAN y del Pacto de Varsovia. El primero promovió la democracia liberal y el capitalismo, mientras que el segundo extendía el comunismo y una economía planificada por el gobierno. Ambos apoyaron varias dictaduras y participaron en guerras subsidiarias. Entre 1950 y 1953, las tropas estadounidenses combatieron a las fuerzas comunistas chinas en la guerra de Corea.[50]​ Desde la ruptura con la URSS y el inicio de la Guerra Fría y hasta 1957, dentro de Estados Unidos se desarrolló el macarthismo, también llamado Segundo Temor rojo, en el que el Estado desató una ola de represión política y una campaña de miedo contra aquellas personas comunistas o simplemente sospechosas de serlo, que algunos autores señalan como propio de un Estado totalitario. Cientos de personas fueron detenidas, incluidas decenas de celebridades, y entre diez mil y doce mil personas perdieron sus puestos de trabajo.[51]​ La persecución finalizó cuando los tribunales la declararon inconstitucional.[52]​\n\nEn 1961, el lanzamiento soviético de la primera nave espacial tripulada provocó que el presidente John F. Kennedy propusiera al país ser los primeros en enviar «un hombre a la Luna», hecho logrado en 1969.[53]​ Kennedy también enfrentó un tenso conflicto nuclear con las fuerzas soviéticas en Cuba, al tiempo que la economía crecía y se expandía de manera constante. Un creciente movimiento por los derechos civiles, representado y liderado por afroamericanos como Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King y James Bevel, utilizó la no violencia para hacer frente a la segregación y la discriminación.[54]​ Después del asesinato de Kennedy en 1963, la Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964 y la Ley de Derechos Electorales de 1965 se aprobaron durante el mandato del presidente Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson y su sucesor, Richard Nixon, llevaron una guerra civil subsidiaria en el sudeste asiático a la infructuosa guerra de Vietnam.[50]​ Un movimiento contracultural generalizado creció, impulsado por la oposición a la guerra, el nacionalismo negro y la revolución sexual. También surgió una nueva ola de movimientos feministas, liderados por Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem y otras mujeres que buscaban la equidad política, social y económica.\n\nEn 1974, como resultado del escándalo Watergate, Nixon se convirtió en el primer presidente en renunciar, para evitar ser destituido por cargos como obstrucción a la justicia y abuso de poder; fue sucedido por el vicepresidente Gerald Ford.[55]​ La administración de Jimmy Carter en la segunda mitad de la década de 1970 (1977-1981) estuvo marcada por la estanflación y la crisis de los rehenes en Irán. La elección de Ronald Reagan como presidente en 1980 anunció un cambio en la política estadounidense, que se reflejó en reformas importantes en los impuestos y gastos fiscales. Su segundo mandato trajo consigo el escándalo Irán-Contra y el significativo progreso diplomático con la Unión Soviética. El posterior colapso soviético terminó la Guerra Fría.\n\nBajo el mandato del presidente George H. W. Bush, el país tomó un papel de liderazgo hegemónico mundial, como en la guerra del Golfo (1991). La expansión económica más larga en la historia moderna de Estados Unidos, desde marzo de 1991 hasta marzo de 2001, abarcó la administración de Bill Clinton y la burbuja punto com.[56]​ Una demanda civil y un escándalo sexual llevó al impeachment de Clinton en 1998, aunque logró terminar su periodo. Las elecciones presidenciales de 2000, de las más competidas en la historia estadounidense, fueron resueltas por una decisión de la Corte Suprema. George W. Bush, hijo de George H. W. Bush, fue proclamado presidente a pesar de que obtuvo menos votos que su rival, Al Gore.[57]​ Esta situación, que ha ocurrido tres veces en la historia, se debe al sistema de voto estadounidense (colegiado).\n\nEl 11 de septiembre de 2001, los terroristas del grupo Al-Qaeda atacaron las Torres Gemelas del World Trade Center de la ciudad de Nueva York (que fueron destruidas) y El Pentágono cerca de Washington D. C., en una serie de atentados que acabó con la vida de casi tres mil personas. En respuesta, la administración de Bush lanzó la «guerra contra el terrorismo». A finales de 2001, las fuerzas estadounidenses invadieron Afganistán, derrocaron al gobierno talibán y destruyeron los campos de entrenamiento de Al-Qaeda. Los insurgentes talibanes continúan luchando una guerra de guerrillas. En 2002 Bush comenzó a presionar para que se llevara a cabo un cambio de régimen en Irak.[58]​[59]​ Con la falta de apoyo de la OTAN y sin un mandato explícito de la ONU para una intervención militar, Bush organizó la coalición de la voluntad; las fuerzas de la coalición rápidamente invadieron Irak en 2003 y derrocaron al dictador Saddam Hussein. Al año siguiente, Bush fue reelegido como el presidente más votado en unas elecciones.\n\nEn 2005, el huracán Katrina, que terminaría siendo el desastre natural más mortífero en la historia nacional, causó una destrucción severa a lo largo de la costa del Golfo: la ciudad de Nueva Orleans quedó devastada,[60]​ con 1833 muertos.\n\nEl 4 de noviembre de 2008, en medio de una recesión económica mundial, Barack Obama fue elegido presidente, habiendo sido el primer afroamericano en ocupar el cargo. En mayo de 2011, las fuerzas especiales estadounidenses lograron matar a Osama bin Laden, escondido en Pakistán. Al año siguiente, Barack Obama fue reelegido. Bajo su segundo mandato impartió la guerra contra el Estado Islámico y se restablecieron las relaciones diplomáticas con Cuba.\n\nEl 8 de noviembre de 2016, el magnate Donald Trump por el Partido Republicano venció a la ex primera dama Hillary Clinton para la presidencia en unas elecciones insólitas[61]​ y cuyos planes han sido descritos por analistas políticos como populistas, proteccionistas y nacionalistas, jurando el cargo el 20 de enero de 2017.\n\nLas masacres en Orlando del 12 de junio de 2016 en la discoteca gay Pulse (51 muertos)[62]​ y en Las Vegas el 1 de octubre de 2017 (60) figuran como las mayores matanzas del país desde los atentados del 11-S.\n\nEl 7 de noviembre de 2020, Joe Biden gana las elecciones presidenciales, venciendo a Donald Trump quien no consiguió la reelección presidencial. Es la segunda vez que un presidente estadounidense no alcanza la reelección después de George H. W. Bush. Biden juró al cargo el 20 de enero de 2021. El 6 de enero de 2021, los partidarios del presidente saliente Trump irrumpieron en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos en un esfuerzo infructuoso por interrumpir el recuento de votos del Colegio Electoral presidencial.[63]​\n\nEstados Unidos es la federación más antigua del mundo. Es una república constitucional, democrática y representativa, «en la que el mandato de la mayoría es regulado por los derechos de las minorías, protegidos por la ley». ​ El gobierno está regulado por un sistema de controles y equilibrios, definidos por la Constitución, que sirve como el documento legal supremo del país.[65]​ En el sistema federalista estadounidense, los ciudadanos están generalmente sujetos a tres niveles de gobierno: federal, estatal y local; los deberes del gobierno local comúnmente se dividen entre los gobiernos de los condados y municipios. En casi todos los casos, los funcionarios del poder ejecutivo y legislativo son elegidos por sufragio directo de los ciudadanos del distrito.\n\nEl gobierno federal se divide en tres ramas de poder:[65]​\n• Poder legislativo: El Congreso bicameral, compuesto por el Senado y la Cámara de Representantes. Su función es crear las leyes federales, hacer declaraciones de guerra, aprobar los tratados, administran los fondos públicos y tiene el poder del impeachment, por medio del cual pueden destituir a funcionarios del gobierno.\n• Poder ejecutivo: El presidente es el comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas, puede vetar los proyectos de ley antes de que se conviertan en leyes oficiales y nombra a los miembros del gabinete (sujeto a la aprobación del Senado) y otros oficiales, que administran y hacer cumplir las leyes federales y políticas.\n• Poder judicial: La Corte Suprema y los tribunales federales inferiores, cuyos jueces son nombrados por el presidente con la aprobación del Senado, interpretan las leyes y suprimen las que se consideren anticonstitucionales.\n\nLa Cámara de Representantes tiene 435 miembros electos, cada uno representando a un distrito del Congreso para un mandato de dos años.[65]​ Los lugares dentro de la cámara se distribuyen entre los estados según su población cada diez años. Según el censo de 2000, siete estados tienen el mínimo de un representante, mientras que California, el estado más poblado, tiene cincuenta y tres. El Senado tiene cien miembros, ya que cada estado cuenta con dos senadores, elegidos para un término de seis años; un tercio de los escaños en el Senado son electos cada dos años.[65]​ La Corte Suprema, liderada por el jefe de justicia, tiene nueve miembros, que sirven de manera permanente.[65]​\n\nEl presidente cumple mandato por un término de cuatro años y podrá ser reelegido para el cargo no más de una vez. El presidente no es elegido por sufragio directo, sino por un sistema indirecto de colegios electorales, en el que los votos determinantes son prorrateados por estado.[65]​ Un estado solo puede brindar determinada cantidad de votos según el número de congresistas que tenga dentro del poder legislativo: senadores (dos por cada estado) y representantes (que varía según la población de cada estado); dando un total de 538 miembros. El sistema bipartidista del país permite que un candidato a la presidencia, ya sea republicano o demócrata, solo necesite 270 votos para asegurar la victoria.[66]​\n\nLos gobiernos de los cincuenta estados están estructurados de manera más o menos similar, aunque Nebraska es el único que tiene una legislatura unicameral.[67]​ El gobernador (jefe ejecutivo) de cada estado es elegido por sufragio directo. Algunos jueces de estado y funcionarios de gabinete son designados por los gobernadores de los respectivos estados, mientras que otros son elegidos por voto popular.\n\nTodas las leyes y los procedimientos gubernamentales están sujetas a revisión judicial, y se anula cualquier ley que esté en contra de la Constitución. El texto original de la Constitución establece la estructura y responsabilidades del gobierno federal y su relación con los gobiernos estados.[65]​ El Artículo I protege el derecho al «gran recurso» de habeas corpus[30]​ y el Artículo III garantiza el derecho a un juicio con jurado en todos los casos penales.[30]​ Las enmiendas a la Constitución requieren la aprobación de tres cuartas partes de los estados. La Constitución ha sido enmendada veintisiete veces; las primeras diez enmiendas, que componen la Carta de Derechos y la decimocuarta enmienda forman la base central de las garantías individuales.[30]​\n\nEstados Unidos ejerce una influencia económica, política y militar a nivel mundial. Es un miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas, además de que la Sede de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas se encuentra en la ciudad de Nueva York. También es miembro del G8, el G-20 y la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico. La inmensa mayoría de los países tienen una embajada o un consulado en Washington D. C. u otra ciudad importante del país. A su vez, casi todos los países del mundo cuentan con una misión diplomática estadounidense.[68]​ Sin embargo, Corea del Norte, Bután, Sudán y la República de China (Taiwán) no tienen relaciones diplomáticas formales con la nación.\n\nTambién goza de fuertes lazos con el Reino Unido, Canadá, Australia, Nueva Zelanda, Japón, Corea del Sur e Israel. Trabaja en estrecha colaboración con sus colegas de la Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte sobre cuestiones militares y de seguridad, y con sus vecinos a través de la Organización de los Estados Americanos y de tratados internacionales como el acuerdo trilateral del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte con Canadá y México. En 2012, Estados Unidos gastó un neto de 30 460 millones de dólares en ayuda oficial al desarrollo, la mayor cantidad en el mundo, aunque en términos de porcentaje del producto interior bruto (PIB), su contribución de 0.19 % ocupó uno de los últimos lugares entre las veintitrés naciones donantes. En contraste, las empresas privadas estadounidenses son relativamente más generosas.[69]​[70]​\n\nEl presidente ostenta el título de comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas de la nación y nombra a sus líderes: el Secretario de Defensa y la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor. El Departamento de Defensa administra las fuerzas armadas, incluyendo el Ejército, la Armada, el Cuerpo de Marines y la Fuerza Aérea. La Guardia Costera es administrada por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional en tiempos de paz y por el Departamento de la Armada en tiempo de guerra. En 2008, las fuerzas armadas contaban con 1.4 millones de miembros activos. Las reservas y la Guardia Nacional elevan el número total de tropas a 2.3 millones. El Departamento de Defensa también emplea a aproximadamente setencientos mil civiles, sin incluir a los contratistas.[71]​\n\nEl servicio militar es voluntario, aunque en tiempos de guerra el Estado puede imponer el reclutamiento a través de un sistema de servicio selectivo, el llamado «Selective Service System».[72]​ Como la gran potencia militar del mundo, las fuerzas armadas de Estados Unidos poseen las más avanzadas máquinas de guerra. Cuenta con miles de aviones, cientos de embarcaciones, carros de combate, misiles intercontinentales (ICBM), miles de ojivas nucleares y tiene diez portaaviones activos en la Armada; además, posee fuerzas aeronavales de carácter permanente en las costas del océano Atlántico ―Fleet Forces Command―, Pacífico ―Flota del Pacífico― y el Golfo Pérsico ―Quinta Flota―.\n\nLa instalación progresiva de las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses a gran escala empezó con la división y ocupación de Alemania en 1945, se amplió con la guerra fría en sus países de influencia, y continúa vigente.\n\nEl ejército opera alrededor de 870 bases e instalaciones en el extranjero[73]​ y mantiene guarniciones de más de 100 militares activos en 28 países distintos.[74]​ El alcance de esta presencia militar global ha llevado a algunos autores a describir al país como si mantuviera un «imperio de bases».[75]​[76]​\n\nLos gastos militares en 2020, fueron de 740 500 millones de dólares,[77]​ aproximadamente el 37.5 % del gasto militar mundial[78]​ y más altos que los gastos juntos de los siguientes catorce países con los ejércitos más grandes. El gasto per cápita fue de 1967 dólares, alrededor de nueve veces el promedio mundial; ocupando el 4.4 % del PIB[79]​ y el 18 % del presupuesto federal.[80]​ El presupuesto base del Departamento de Defensa para 2010 ―fijado en 533 800 millones de dólares― aumentó un 4 % en 2009 y un 80 % más que en 2001; se destinarán 130 000 millones de dólares adicionales para las campañas militares en Irak y Afganistán.[81]​ En mayo de 2010 había 94 000 soldados estadounidenses desplegados en Afganistán y 92 000 en Irak.[82]​ Para junio de 2010, el ejército estadounidense había sufrido 4400 bajas durante la guerra en Irak[83]​ y 1087 durante la guerra en Afganistán.[84]​\n\nEstados Unidos cuenta, según las informaciones disponibles, con los mayores servicios de inteligencia del mundo, que se agrupan y coordinan alrededor de la llamada Comunidad de Inteligencia ―United States Intelligence Community (IC)―. Diecisiete agencias federales de inteligencia forman esta comunidad; estas agencias generalmente están subordinadas al Departamento de Defensa o al Departamento de Justicia, mientras que otras tienen la consideración de agencia independiente federal, por lo que solo deben rendir cuentas al Director Nacional de Inteligencia y al Presidente de los Estados Unidos. Las agencias de la comunidad ―tanto militares como civiles― se dedican a actividades de inteligencia relacionadas con asuntos exteriores y la seguridad nacional y cuentan con cientos de miles de empleados ―107 035 a mediados de 2013, último dato conocido―[85]​ y unos presupuestos confidenciales que solo en 2013 sumaron 52 600 millones de dólares.[85]​ Una de las agencias que la componen es la célebre Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA).[86]​\n\nEn 2010, según informaciones de The Washington Post, 1271 organizaciones gubernamentales, 1931 empresas privadas y 854 000 personas con acceso a espacios e información de alto secreto se dedicaban en Estados Unidos a labores de contraterrorismo, inteligencia y seguridad nacional.[87]​\n\nEn materia de derechos humanos, respecto a la pertenencia a los siete organismos de la Carta Internacional de Derechos Humanos, que incluyen al Comité de Derechos Humanos (HRC), Estados Unidos de América ha firmado o ratificado:\n\nEstados Unidos es una unión federal de cincuenta estados. Los trece estados originales fueron los sucesores de las Trece Colonias que se rebelaron contra el Imperio británico. Poco después de la independencia, se crearon tres nuevos estados a partir de otros ya existentes: Kentucky de Virginia; Tennessee de Carolina del Norte y Maine de Massachusetts. La mayoría de los otros estados fueron creados a partir de territorios obtenidos a través de la guerra o la compra por parte del gobierno. Vermont, Texas y Hawái son la excepción: cada uno de ellos fue una república independiente antes de integrarse a la Unión. Durante la guerra de Secesión, Virginia Occidental se separó de Virginia. El estado más reciente es Hawái, que logró el reconocimiento como estado el 21 de agosto de 1959. Los estados no tienen el derecho de separarse de la Unión.\n\nLos estados componen gran parte del territorio estadounidense; las otras dos áreas que se consideran parte integrante del país son el Distrito de Columbia ―el distrito federal donde se encuentra la capital Washington D. C.― y el Atolón Palmyra, un territorio deshabitado pero incorporado, ubicado en el océano Pacífico. Estados Unidos también posee cinco grandes territorios de ultramar: Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes de los Estados Unidos en el Caribe y Samoa Americana, Guam y las Islas Marianas del Norte en el Pacífico. Aquellos que nacieron en esos territorios (excepto en la Samoa Americana) poseen la ciudadanía estadounidense. Los ciudadanos estadounidenses que residen en los territorios tienen muchos de los derechos y responsabilidades de los ciudadanos que residen en los estados; sin embargo, generalmente están exentos del pago de impuestos federales, no pueden votar en las elecciones presidenciales y solo tienen representación en calidad de observadores en el Congreso. ​\n\nLa superficie de los Estados Unidos continentales es de aproximadamente 7 700 000 km² (kilómetros cuadrados). Alaska, que está separada de los Estados Unidos continentales por Canadá, es el estado más grande del país, con 1 500 000 km². Hawái, ocupa un archipiélago ubicado en el Pacífico central, al suroeste de América del Norte, que abarca poco más de 16 000 km².[99]​ Después de Rusia y Canadá, es el tercer o cuarto país más grande del mundo por área total (tierra y agua), clasificado justo por encima o por debajo de China. La lista varía dependiendo de si se consideran los territorios en disputa entre China y la India y de cómo se calcula el tamaño total de los Estados Unidos: The World Factbook de la CIA considera 9 833 517 km²,[5]​ la División de Estadísticas de las Naciones Unidas calcula 9 629 091 km²,[100]​ y la Enciclopedia Británica estipula 9 522 055 km².[101]​ Incluyendo solo la superficie de la tierra, Estados Unidos es tercero en tamaño detrás de Rusia y Canadá, justo por delante de China.[102]​\n\nEl territorio nacional cuenta con múltiples formas de relieve y accidentes geográficos. A medida que se avanza tierra adentro, la llanura costera del litoral Atlántico da lugar al bosque caducifolio y a la meseta de Piedmont. Los Apalaches separan la costa oriental de los Grandes Lagos de las praderas del Medio Oeste. El río Misisipi-Misuri, el cuarto sistema fluvial más largo del mundo, corre de norte a sur a través del centro del país. La pradera llana y fértil de las Grandes Llanuras se extiende hacia el oeste, hasta que es interrumpida por una región de tierras altas en el sureste. Las Montañas Rocosas, en el borde occidental de las Grandes Llanuras, atraviesan de norte a sur todo el país, llegando a altitudes superiores a los 4300 m s. n. m. (metros sobre el nivel del mar) en Colorado. Más hacia el oeste se encuentra la Gran Cuenca y los desiertos, tales como el desierto de Mojave, de Sonora y de Chihuahua. Las montañas de la Sierra Nevada y la cordillera de las Cascadas se encuentran cerca de la costa del Pacífico. Con sus 6194 m s. n. m., el monte McKinley en Alaska es el punto más alto del país. Los volcanes activos son comunes a lo largo de Alaska y las islas Aleutianas, además de que Hawái consta de solo islas volcánicas. El supervolcán ubicado debajo del parque nacional Yellowstone en las montañas Rocosas, es la forma volcánica más grande del continente.[103]​\n\nPor su gran tamaño y variedad geográfica, el país cuenta con la mayoría de los tipos de clima. Al este del meridiano 100, el clima varía de continental húmedo en el norte a húmedo subtropical en el sur. El extremo sur de la Florida y las islas de Hawái tienen un clima tropical. Las Grandes Llanuras al oeste del meridiano 100 son semiáridas, mientras que gran parte de las montañas occidentales poseen un clima alpino. El clima es árido en la Gran Cuenca y en los desiertos del suroeste, es mediterráneo en la costa de California y oceánico en la costa sur de Alaska, Oregón y Washington. La mayor parte del territorio alaskeño tiene un clima subártico o polar. Los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos no son raros; los estados ribereños del golfo de México son propensos a huracanes y la mayoría de los tornados del mundo se desarrollan dentro del país, principalmente en la zona de Tornado Alley, en el Medio Oeste.[104]​\n\nEstados Unidos es considerado un país megadiverso: unas 17 000 especies de plantas vasculares viven en los Estados Unidos contiguos y Alaska y más de 1800 especies de plantas con flores se pueden encontrar tan solo en Hawái, pocas de las cuales crecen en el continente.[105]​ El país es el hábitat de más de 400 especies de mamíferos, 750 especies de aves y 500 especies de reptiles y anfibios.[106]​ Aquí también se han descubierto más de 91 000 diferentes clases de insectos.[107]​\n\nLa Ley de Especies en Peligro aprobada en 1973 protege a las especies amenazadas y en peligro de extinción y sus hábitats, que son supervisados por el Servicio de Pesca y Vida Silvestre de los Estados Unidos. En total, el gobierno federal posee el 28.8 % de la superficie total del país.[108]​ La mayor parte de este porcentaje está conformado por los cincuenta y ocho parques nacionales y cientos de otras áreas naturales protegidas administradas por las autoridades federales y estatales.[109]​ Del resto de las tierras del gobierno, algunas son alquiladas para la extracción de petróleo y gas natural, para la minería, agricultura o ganadería; solo el 2.4 % se utiliza para fines militares.[108]​\n\nLa economía de los Estados Unidos es una economía mixta capitalista, que se caracteriza por los abundantes recursos naturales, una infraestructura desarrollada y una alta productividad. ​ De acuerdo al Fondo Monetario Internacional, su PIB de 15.7 billones USD constituye el 24 % del Producto Mundial Bruto y cerca del 21 % del mismo en términos de paridad de poder adquisitivo (PPA).[9]​ Este es el PIB más grande en el mundo, aunque en 2008 era un 5 % menor que el PIB (PPA) de la Unión Europea. El país tiene el undécimo PIB per cápita nominal y el sexto PIB (PPA) per cápita más altos del mundo.[9]​ Además, el país está en segundo lugar del Índice de Competitividad Global de 2010.[111]​\n\nEstados Unidos es el importador de bienes más grande a nivel internacional y el tercero en términos de exportaciones, aunque las exportaciones per cápita son relativamente bajas para ser un país desarrollado. En 2008, el total de la balanza comercial estadounidense era de 696 000 millones de dólares.[112]​ En 2009, los automóviles constituyeron los principales productos exportados e importados.[113]​ Canadá, China, México, Alemania y Japón son sus principales socios comerciales.[114]​ Ese último es el que tiene la mayor deuda pública con Estados Unidos, ya que a principios de 2010 superó la deuda de China con 34 200 millones de dólares.[115]​\n\nEn 2010, el sector privado constituía un estimado del 55.3 % de la economía de Estados Unidos, las actividades del gobierno federal sumaban el 24.1 % y la actividad de los gobiernos estatales y locales ocupaban el restante 20.6 %.[118]​ Pese a que la economía estadounidense es posindustrial, ya que el sector servicios contribuye con el 67.8 % del PIB, la nación continúa siendo una potencia industrial.[119]​ En el campo de negocios, la actividad líder por sus ingresos es el comercio al por mayor y al por menor; por ingresos netos es la industria,[120]​ siendo la industria química la más importante.[121]​ Estados Unidos es el tercer productor de petróleo más importante en el mundo, así como el mayor importador de este producto.[122]​[123]​[124]​ También es el productor número uno de energía eléctrica y de energía nuclear, así como gas natural licuado, azufre, fosfatos y sal. Mientras que la agricultura representa menos del 1 % del PIB,[119]​ el país es el mayor productor de maíz[125]​ y soya.[126]​ Toda esta producción contribuye a que la bolsa de Nueva York sea la más grande del mundo.[127]​ A su vez, las empresas estadounidenses de Coca-Cola, McDonalds y Microsoft son las marcas más reconocidas en el mundo.[128]​\n\nEn el tercer trimestre de 2009, la fuerza de trabajo estadounidense era de 154.4 millones de personas. De estos empleados, un 81 % poseía un empleo en el sector de los servicios. Con 22.4 millones de personas, el gobierno es el principal campo de empleo.[129]​ Aproximadamente el 12 % de los trabajadores están sindicalizados, en comparación con el 30 % de Europa occidental.[130]​ El Banco Mundial clasifica a los Estados Unidos en primer lugar en la facilidad de contratación y liquidación de los trabajadores.[131]​ Entre 1973 y 2003, el año laboral para un estadounidense promedio creció 199 horas.[132]​ En parte como consecuencia, el país sostiene la máxima productividad de mano de obra en el mundo. En 2008, también llegó al primer puesto en productividad por hora, superando a Noruega, Francia, Bélgica y Luxemburgo, que habían superado a los Estados Unidos la mayor parte de la década anterior.[133]​ Comparado con Europa, los impuestos corporativos y de propiedad son más altos, mientras que los impuestos al consumidor son más bajos.[134]​\n\nAl ser un país desarrollado, Estados Unidos cuenta con una infraestructura de transportes avanzada: 6 465 799 km (kilómetros) de carreteras, 226 427 km de vías férreas, 15 095 aeropuertos y 41 009 km de vías fluviales.[136]​ La mayor parte de sus habitantes utilizan el automóvil como su principal medio de transporte. En 2003, había 759 automóviles por cada 1000 personas, en comparación con los 472 por cada 1000 habitantes de la Unión Europea.[137]​ Más del 40 % de los vehículos personales son camionetas, todoterrenos o camiones ligeros.[138]​ El adulto estadounidense promedio (incluyendo a conductores y no conductores) pasa diariamente 55 minutos en un automóvil, viajando una distancia de 47 km.[139]​\n\nLa industria aérea civil es propiedad privada, mientras que la mayoría de aeropuertos son de propiedad pública. Las tres aerolíneas más grandes en el mundo son de capital estadounidense: Southwest Airlines, American Airlines y Delta Air Lines.[140]​ De los treinta aeropuertos con mayor tránsito de pasajeros en el mundo, dieciséis están en el país, siendo el más concurrido de todos el Aeropuerto Internacional Hartsfield-Jackson en Atlanta.[141]​ Mientras que el transporte de mercancías por ferrocarril es muy importante, relativamente pocas personas utilizan este medio de transporte para viajar, dentro o entre las zonas urbanas.[142]​ Solamente el 9 % de las personas utilizan el transporte público para acudir al trabajo, un nivel muy bajo comparado con el 38.8 % de Europa.[143]​ También el uso de la bicicleta es mínimo, muy por debajo de los niveles europeos.[144]​\n\nEl consumo energético total del país es de 3873 billones kWh anuales, lo que equivale a un consumo per cápita de 7.8 toneladas de petróleo al año.[136]​ En 2005, un 40 % de esta energía provenía del petróleo, 23 % del carbón y 22 % del gas natural; el resto provenía de centrales nucleares y fuentes de energía renovable.[145]​ Estados Unidos es el mayor consumidor de petróleo y de gas natural: anualmente utiliza 19.5 millones de barriles de petróleo y 627 200 millones de metros cúbicos de gas natural.[123]​[146]​ Por otro lado, en el país se encuentran el 27 % de las reservas mundiales de carbón.[147]​ Por décadas, la energía nuclear ha jugado un papel limitado en la producción de energía, en comparación con la mayoría de los países desarrollados, debido en parte a la reacción pública después del accidente de Three Mile Island. Sin embargo, en 2007 el gobierno recibió múltiples peticiones para la construcción de nuevas centrales nucleares, lo que podría significar una disminución considerable en el consumo de combustibles fósiles[148]​ y un cambio en la política energética.\n\nEn el último censo decenal del país (2020), la cifra asciende a 331 449 281 de habitantes en abril de 2020 según la Oficina Nacional del Censo.[149]​ Esta cifra incluye un estimado de 11.2 millones de inmigrantes ilegales,[150]​ pero excluye la población de cinco territorios no incorporados (Puerto Rico, Islas Vírgenes de los Estados Unidos, Guam, Samoa americana e Islas Marianas del Norte). Esto la convierte en la tercera nación más poblada en el mundo, después de China y la India. Además, Estados Unidos es la única nación industrializada donde se prevé un aumento significativo en la población.[151]​ Con una tasa de natalidad de 13.82 bebés por cada 1000 habitantes (30 % por debajo de la media mundial), su tasa de crecimiento demográfico es de 0.98 %, significativamente más alto que los de Europa occidental, Japón y Corea del Sur.[152]​ En el año fiscal de 2009, 1.1 millones de inmigrantes obtuvieron la residencia legal.[153]​ México ha sido el principal país de origen de los nuevos residentes durante más de dos décadas; desde 1998, China, India y Filipinas también se han destacado en este sentido cada año.[154]​\n\nEstados Unidos tiene una población muy diversa: treinta y un diferentes grupos étnicos cuentan con más de un millón de representantes.[155]​ Los blancos estadounidenses son el grupo étnico más grande; los germano-estadounidenses, los hiberno-estadounidenses y los angloamericanos constituyen tres de los cuatro grupos étnicos más numerosos del país.[155]​ Los afroamericanos son la «minoría» racial más importante y el tercer grupo étnico más grande.[155]​[156]​ Los asiáticos son la segunda «minoría» racial con mayor presencia; dentro de este grupo destacan los grupos de origen chino y filipino.[155]​ En 2008, la población incluía un estimado de 6 millones de personas con ascendencia indígena, ya sea de un pueblo amerindio (1.8 millones), alaskeño (3.1 millones), hawaiano (500 000) o de una isla del Pacífico (600 000).[156]​\n\nEl crecimiento de la población de origen latinoamericano es una importante tendencia demográfica. De acuerdo a la Oficina Nacional del Censo, los 46.9 millones de descendientes de latinos o hispanos[156]​ son un grupo heterogéneo que comparten una distinta «etnicidad», así 64 % de los hispanos son de ascendencia mexicana.[157]​ Entre 2000 y 2008, la población hispana aumentó 32 %, mientras que la población no hispana aumentó solo un 4.3 %.[156]​ Gran parte de este crecimiento es debido a la inmigración, por ejemplo, en 2007 el 12.6 % de la población estadounidense había nacido en el extranjero, de los cuales, el 54 % nacieron en América Latina.[158]​ La tasa de fecundidad también es un factor: la mujer hispana promedio da a luz a tres niños, mientras que las mujeres negras tienen 2.2 y las mujeres blancas 1.8.[151]​ Las minorías (definidas por la Oficina del Censo como todos aquellos que no son hispanos o blancos) constituyen el 34 % de la población y se prevé que constituirán la mayoría para el 2042.[159]​\n\nAlrededor del 82 % de los estadounidenses viven en zonas urbanas (tal como las define la Oficina del Censo, estas áreas incluyen los suburbios);[136]​ cerca de la mitad residen en ciudades con una población superior a cincuenta mil habitantes.[160]​ En 2008, 273 localidades contaban con más de cien mil personas, nueve ciudades tenían más de un millón de residentes y cuatro ciudades globales tenían más de dos millones de residentes (Nueva York, Los Ángeles, Chicago y Houston).[161]​ Existen cincuenta y dos áreas metropolitanas con más de un millón de habitantes.[162]​ De las cincuenta áreas metropolitanas de más rápido crecimiento demográfico, cuarenta y siete se encuentran en el oeste y en el sur.[163]​ Las áreas metropolitanas de Dallas, Houston, Atlanta y Phoenix aumentaron su población en más de un millón de personas entre 2000 y 2008.[162]​\n\nLa educación pública estadounidense es operada por los gobiernos estatales y locales, regulados por el Departamento de Educación de los Estados Unidos. Es obligatorio que los niños asistan a la escuela desde los seis o siete años (por lo general, al jardín de niños o al primer grado de educación primaria) hasta que cumplen los dieciocho años (generalmente hasta cursar el duodécimo grado, el final de la escuela secundaria); algunos estados permiten a los estudiantes abandonar la escuela a los dieciséis o diecisiete años.[164]​ Aproximadamente el 12 % de los niños están inscritos en escuelas privadas, mientras que el 2 % recibe educación en el hogar.[165]​ Existen múltiples instituciones privadas y públicas de educación superior, así como de colleges comunitarios con las políticas de admisión abierta. De las personas mayores de veinticinco años, el 84.6 % se graduó de la escuela secundaria, un 52.6 % asistió a algún college, el 27.2 % obtuvo una licenciatura y el 9.6 % obtuvo un título de posgrado.[166]​ La tasa de alfabetización es de aproximadamente un 99 %.[136]​ La ONU le asigna al país un índice de educación de 0.97, el 12.º más alto en el mundo.[167]​ De acuerdo a la Unesco, Estados Unidos es el segundo país con más instituciones de educación superior en el mundo, con un total de 5758 y un promedio de más de 15 por cada estado.[168]​ El país también cuenta con el mayor número de estudiantes universitarios en el mundo, ascendiendo a 14 261 778, es decir, casi el 4.75 % de la población total.[169]​ Finalmente, aquí se encuentran algunas de las universidades más prestigiosas y de mayor fama en todo el mundo. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford y el Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts son consideradas como las mejores universidades por varias publicaciones.[170]​[171]​[172]​\n\nEl inglés es el idioma nacional de facto. Aunque no existe ningún idioma oficial a nivel federal, algunas leyes ―como los Requisitos para la Naturalización― colocan al inglés como idioma obligatorio. En 2006, cerca de 241 millones, o sea, el 78 % de la población mayor de cinco años, hablaba únicamente el inglés en casa. El español, hablado por el 13 % de la población, es el segundo idioma más hablado, y el que más comúnmente se aprende como segunda lengua.[173]​[174]​ Algunas personas abogan por convertir el inglés en el idioma oficial, como lo es en al menos 28 estados.[175]​ El hawaiano y el inglés son los idiomas oficiales de Hawái,[176]​ mientras que el siux y el inglés son los de Dakota del Sur.[177]​\n\nAunque carecen de un idioma oficial, Nuevo México tiene leyes que alientan el uso del inglés y el español, de la misma forma que Luisiana lo hace con el inglés y el francés cajún. ​ En otros estados, como en California, la publicación de ciertos documentos oficiales en español es obligatoria.[179]​[180]​ Los territorios insulares garantizan el reconocimiento oficial de los idiomas nativos, junto con el inglés: el samoano y el chamorro son reconocidos por Samoa Americana y Guam, respectivamente; el carolinio y el chamorro son reconocidos por las Islas Marianas del Norte, y el español es un idioma oficial de Puerto Rico.\n\nAdemás de las lenguas mencionadas, se siguen hablando un número elevado de lenguas nativas en numerosas reservas por todo el país y pequeñas localidades. Cada una de estas lenguas cuenta con unos pocos de miles de hablantes, y la más importante demográficamente es el navajo, con casi doscientos mil hablantes nativos.\n\nEstados Unidos es oficialmente un Estado laico; la Primera Enmienda garantiza el libre ejercicio de la religión y prohíbe el establecimiento de cualquier gobierno religioso.[30]​ En un estudio de 2002, el 59 % de los estadounidenses aseguró que la religión desempeñaba un «papel muy importante en sus vidas», una cifra más elevada que la de cualquier otra nación desarrollada.[181]​ De acuerdo con una encuesta de 2007, un 78.4 % de los adultos se identificaron como cristianos,[182]​ registrándose una disminución desde 1990, cuando eran el 86.4 %.[183]​ Las denominaciones protestantes representaban el 51.3 %, mientras que la Iglesia católica con el 23.9 %, era la corriente religiosa más grande. El estudio clasifica a los evangélicos blancos, 26.3 % de la población, como la cohorte religiosa más grande del país;[182]​ otro estudio estima que los evangélicos de todas las razas conforman entre el 30 y 35 % de la población.[184]​ En 1990, el total de adeptos a religiones no cristianas eran el 3.3 %, para 2007 había crecido hasta un 4.7 %.[183]​ Las principales religiones no cristianas eran el judaísmo (1.7 %), el budismo (0.7 %), el islam (0.6 %), el hinduismo (0.4 %) y el unitarismo universalista (0.3 %).[182]​ La encuesta también informó que el 16.1 % de los estadounidenses se describían a sí mismos como agnósticos, ateos o simplemente sin ninguna religión.[182]​[183]​\n\nEn 2006, la esperanza de vida era de 77.8 años,[185]​ siendo un año más corta que el promedio de Europa occidental, y mucho más corta que la de países como Noruega, Suiza y Canadá.[186]​ Durante las últimas dos décadas, el nivel de esperanza de vida cayó del 11.º lugar mundial, hasta el 42.º.[187]​ La mortalidad infantil es de 6.37 fallecimientos por cada 1000 nacidos vivos.[188]​ Aproximadamente un tercio de la población adulta es obesa y otro tercio tiene sobrepeso;[189]​ el índice de obesidad, uno de los más altos del mundo, se ha duplicado en los últimos veinticinco años. ​ La alta incidencia de diabetes tipo 2 relacionada con la obesidad se considera una epidemia por algunos profesionales de la salud.[191]​ El índice de embarazos en la adolescencia asciende a 79.8 por cada 1000 mujeres, cuatro veces el índice de Francia y cinco veces el de Alemania.[192]​ El aborto, legal en algunos casos, es un tema muy controvertido: muchos estados prohibieron la financiación pública del procedimiento, restringieron el aborto cuando el feto ya está desarrollado, requieren notificación parental para las menores y un período de espera. La tasa de aborto está disminuyendo, ya que existen 241 por cada 1000 nacimientos, aunque sigue siendo superior al de la mayoría de las naciones occidentales.[193]​\n\nEl gasto en el sistema de atención a la salud sobrepasa al de cualquier otra nación, tanto en términos de gasto per cápita como en porcentaje del PIB.[194]​ En 2000, la Organización Mundial de la Salud colocó el sistema de salud estadounidense en primer lugar en la capacidad de respuesta, pero 37.º en rendimiento global. Estados Unidos es líder en innovación médica. En 2004, este sector invirtió tres veces más que cualquier país de Europa en la investigación biomédica.[195]​\n\nEstados Unidos es sede de muchos de los mejores centros médicos del mundo. Gran parte de las instalaciones médicas son de propiedad privada que cuentan con algunos subsidios del gobierno local. A pesar de ser asociaciones sin fines de lucro, muchos de los hospitales más importantes del país están afiliados a grandes corporaciones o escuelas de medicina, que han hecho posible que anualmente estos centros alberguen a cerca del 70 % de todos los pacientes médicos del país.[196]​ El Hospital Johns Hopkins, la Clínica Mayo, el Hospital General de Massachusetts y la Clínica Cleveland se encuentran entre los mejores hospitales del país y del mundo.[197]​\n\nA diferencia de otros países desarrollados, la cobertura del sistema de salud no es universal. En 2004, los seguros médicos pagaron el 36 % de los gastos en materia de salud y los gobiernos federales y estatales otorgaron el 44 %.[198]​ En 2005, 46.6 millones de estadounidenses, 15.9 % de la población, no estaban asegurados, 5.4 millones más que en 2001. La principal causa de este aumento es la caída en el número de empleos donde se garantiza el seguro médico.[199]​ El tema de los estadounidenses no asegurados es una cuestión política importante.[200]​[201]​ Un estudio de 2009 estimó que la falta de seguros está asociada con casi 45 000 muertes al año.[202]​ En 2006, Massachusetts se convirtió en el primer estado en implementar la asistencia sanitaria universal.[203]​ La ley federal aprobada a principios de 2010 creará un sistema de salud casi universal para todo el país en 2014.[cita requerida]\n\nDelincuencia y aplicación de la ley\n\nSegún datos de 2020, Estados Unidos tiene una tasa de homicidios intencionales de 7 por cada 100 000 habitantes.[205]​ Un análisis transversal de la base de datos de mortalidad de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de 2010 mostró que las tasas de homicidio de Estados Unidos fueron 7 veces más altas que en otros países de altos ingresos, impulsadas por una tasa de homicidios con armas de fuego que fue 25.2 veces más alta.[206]​ Entre 1980 y 2008 los hombres cometieron el 77 % de los homicidios y el 90 % de los crímenes. La población negra se vio involucrada en el 52.5 % de los homicidios, una proporción ocho veces mayor que la población blanca (incluyendo a la mayoría de hispanos como «blancos») y fueron víctimas en una proporción seis veces mayor que los blancos. La mayoría de homicidios fueron entre personas de la misma etnia, ya que un 93 % de los negros fueron asesinados por negros y un 84 % de los blancos por blancos.[207]​ De los países desarrollados, Estados Unidos es, con diferencia, el país que tiene un mayor índice de delitos con violencia, homicidios y violencia armada.[208]​ Un análisis de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de 2003 reveló que Estados Unidos «tenía una tasa de homicidios 6.9 veces superior a las tasas registradas en el resto de los países de ingresos altos, tasa impulsada al alza debido a que su tasa de homicidios por arma de fuego era 19.5 veces mayor».[209]​ El derecho a comprar y portar un arma de fuego, consagrado en la Segunda Enmienda a la Constitución, sigue siendo objeto de debate político y social.\n\nLa responsabilidad legal de aplicar y hacer cumplir las leyes en Estados Unidos recae principalmente en los cuerpos de policía local, en los alguaciles ―llamados sheriff o marshal, dependiendo del estado― y sus departamentos y en la policía estatal. A nivel federal existen varias agencias federales, como la Oficina Federal de Investigación (FBI) y el Cuerpo de Alguaciles de Estados Unidos, especializados en determinadas funciones.[210]​ A nivel federal y en casi todos los estados impera el derecho consuetudinario. En el país existen dos tipos de tribunales, los tribunales estatales, encargados de estudiar y juzgar delitos ordinarios, y los tribunales federales, encargados de juzgar ciertos delitos designados y resolver apelaciones procedentes de sentencias de tribunales estatales. Los acuerdos entre las partes es la forma más común de terminar los juicios, pues en la gran mayoría de casos penales se alcanza un acuerdo con el fiscal antes de celebrarse un juicio con jurado.[211]​[212]​\n\nLa pena de muerte sigue siendo un tipo de condena legalmente, y sigue contemplada para ciertos delitos federales y militares en 32 de los 50 estados del país.[213]​ Entre 1967 y 1977 no se realizó ninguna ejecución, debido, en parte, a un fallo de la Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos que prohibía la imposición arbitraria de la pena capital. En 1976, el mismo tribunal dictaminó que, en circunstancias adecuadas, la pena de muerte podía aplicarse sin que ello violara la legalidad constitucional. Desde esta decisión, Estados Unidos ha ejecutado a más de 1300 reos, la mayoría de ellos en Texas, Virginia y Oklahoma.[214]​ Por otro lado, son varios los estados que han ido aboliendo por ley o simplemente dejado de aplicar la pena de muerte. En 2010, Estados Unidos fue el quinto país en número de ejecuciones, detrás de tan solo China, Irán, Corea del Norte y Yemen.[215]​\n\nEstados Unidos es el país con una mayor tasa de encarcelamiento documentado del mundo y tiene la mayor población carcelaria del mundo.[216]​[217]​ A inicios de 2008, más de 2.3 millones de personas estaban encarceladas, más de uno de cada 100 adultos del país.[218]​ Entre presos y personas en libertad condicional, el sistema penitenciario supervisaba a uno de cada 31 adultos del país en 2010,[219]​ cifra que para 2012 se había rebajado a 1 de cada 35 adultos (la tasa más baja desde 1997), haciendo un total de 6 937 600 personas.[220]​ La población carcelaria se ha cuadruplicado desde 1980.[221]​ El coste de mantener a los presos y las instalaciones, sumado a la construcción de nuevas prisiones debido a la masificación, asciende a más de sesenta mil millones de dólares anuales; esto provoca que algunos estados del país tengan que destinar al sistema penitenciario un 10 % de sus ingresos, en el caso de California, estado a la cabeza en número de prisioneros, en el año 2010 dedicó más dinero a esta faceta que, por ejemplo, a educación.[219]​ Los presos más comunes son los varones afroamericanos, con una tasa de encarcelados tres veces mayor que los hispanos y seis veces mayor que la de los varones blancos.[222]​ La alta tasa de presos puede explicarse en parte por las duras leyes promulgadas durante las últimas décadas para combatir el tráfico, posesión y consumo de drogas.[223]​ En 2008 Luisiana fue el estado con mayor tasa de encarcelados y Maine el de menor tasa.[224]​\n\nEl sistema penitenciario de Estados Unidos es duramente criticado tanto por analistas como por algunas organizaciones. Además de la privatización progresiva del sistema penitenciario desde la década de 1980, en 2014 la ONG Human Rights Watch y otras organizaciones denunciaron que más de ochenta mil presos se encuentran en celdas de aislamiento minúsculas, que las ONG califican como cámaras de tortura.[225]​ En 2012, The New York Times denunció que unos sesenta mil indocumentados recluidos en centros de detención son utilizados como mano de obra barata por el gobierno o empresas privadas, con salarios que pueden llegar a ser de 13 centavos la hora; en algunos casos ni siquiera se les retribuye.[226]​ Algunos estados también emplean a miles de reclusos de sus prisiones en fábricas de algunas empresas a cambio de la reducción de su condena o el salario mínimo. Esto supone un ahorro para las empresas de millones de dólares al año en salarios, aunque su legalidad está cuestionada.[227]​ Algunas de las empresas involucradas serían, directamente o a través de subcontrataciones, Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks o Victoria’s Secret, entre otras.[227]​\n\nEstados Unidos es una nación multicultural, hogar de una amplia variedad de grupos étnicos, tradiciones y valores.[14]​[228]​ Aparte de las ahora pequeñas poblaciones de nativos americanos y hawaianos, casi todos los estadounidenses o sus antepasados emigraron durante los últimos cinco siglos. ​ La cultura común para la mayoría de los estadounidenses es una cultura occidental, que en gran parte proviene de las tradiciones de los inmigrantes europeos con influencias de muchas otras fuentes, tales como las tradiciones traídas por los esclavos de África.[14]​ ​ ​ Recientemente, los inmigrantes de Asia y Latinoamérica han añadido más elementos a esta mezcla cultural que ha sido descrita como «un crisol de razas homogeneizados y en una ensaladera heterogénea», en donde los inmigrantes y sus descendientes retienen, comparten y absorben varias características culturales distintivas.[14]​\n\nDe acuerdo con un análisis de dimensiones culturales elaborado por Geert Hofstede, Estados Unidos tiene uno de los índices de individualismo más alto que cualquier otro país estudiado.[232]​ Mientras que en la cultura popular se considera al país como una sociedad sin clases sociales, ​ varios estudiosos identifican diferencias significativas que pueden considerarse como clases sociales, que afectan a la socialización, el idioma y los valores.[234]​[235]​ La clase media trabajadora estadounidense ha sido la iniciadora de muchas de las tendencias sociales contemporáneas como el feminismo moderno, el ecologismo y el multiculturalismo.[236]​ A diferencia de otras culturas, la mayoría de las mujeres trabajan fuera del hogar y cuenta con alguna licenciatura.[237]​ En 2007, 58 % de las estadounidenses mayores de 18 años se habían casado, 6 % estaban viudas, 10 % se divorciaron y el 25 % nunca se había casado.[238]​\n\nEl mismo estudio de Hofstede también reveló que el punto de vista social de los estadounidenses, sus expectativas culturales y la imagen que tienen de sí mismos están asociadas con sus empleos y ocupaciones en un grado inusitadamente estrecho.[239]​ Así también se tiene la tendencia a valorar más los logros socioeconómicos, de tal modo que el hecho de ser una persona ordinaria o promedio es visto como un atributo positivo en la mayoría de los casos.[240]​ Pese a que el llamado «sueño americano» y la percepción de que los estadounidenses disfrutan de una alta movilidad social desempeñan un papel clave en la atracción de los inmigrantes, algunos analistas encuentran que Estados Unidos tiene una menor movilidad social que los países de Europa y Canadá.[241]​[242]​\n\nDesde la colonización europea, el arte estadunidense se mantuvo apegado a las corrientes artísticas del Viejo Continente. A mediados del siglo XIX, surgió la Escuela del río Hudson, uno de los primeros movimientos artísticos desarrollado en el país, aunque todavía se encontraba muy influenciado por la tradición europea del naturalismo. En 1913, el Armory Show de la ciudad de Nueva York, una exhibición de obras del arte moderno europeo, causó un gran impacto en el público y transformó la escena artística estadunidense.[243]​ Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley y otros artistas experimentaron con nuevos estilos, mostrando una sensibilidad y técnica sin precedentes en los artistas europeos. Los movimientos artísticos más importantes como el expresionismo abstracto de Jackson Pollock y Willem de Kooning y el pop art de Andy Warhol y Roy Lichtenstein se desarrollaron en gran medida en los Estados Unidos. De igual forma, la corriente del modernismo y el posmodernismo llevaron a la fama a varios arquitectos estadounidenses como Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson y Frank Gehry.\n\nUno de los más grandes promotores del teatro en Estados Unidos fue el empresario P. T. Barnum, quien se introdujo en el negocio del entretenimiento del bajo Manhattan en 1841. A finales de la década de 1870, el equipo Harrigan and Hart produjo una serie de comedias musicales muy exitosas en Nueva York. En el siglo XX, el formato para los musicales modernos emergió de Broadway; las canciones compuestas por personajes como Irving Berlin, Cole Porter y Stephen Sondheim se convirtieron en estándares para la música pop. El dramaturgo Eugene O'Neill ganó el Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1936; otros escritores estadounidenses aclamados incluyen a ganadores de un Premio Pulitzer, como Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee y August Wilson.\n\nCoreógrafos como Isadora Duncan y Martha Graham ayudaron al desarrollo de la danza moderna, mientras que George Balanchine y Jerome Robbins fueron dos de las grandes figuras del ballet del siglo XX. Los estadounidenses han jugado un papel importante en el medio artístico de la fotografía, destacando entre ellos Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen y Ansel Adams.\n\nLa primera función de cine en la historia se realizó en 1894 en la ciudad de Nueva York, utilizando el quinetoscopio de Thomas Edison. El año siguiente fue presentada la primera proyección de una película con fines comerciales, también en Nueva York, y durante las décadas siguientes Estados Unidos estuvo a la vanguardia del desarrollo del cine sonoro. Desde principios del siglo XX, la industria del cine estadounidense se ha centrado en gran medida alrededor de las producciones de Hollywood, California. El director D. W. Griffith fue fundamental para el desarrollo de la estructura básica de una película y Citizen Kane (1941) de Orson Welles es citada frecuentemente como la mejor película de todos los tiempos.[244]​[245]​ Otros directores fundamentales de esta nacionalidad en la historia del cine: John Ford, Howard Hawks, Elia Kazan o Michael Curtiz, y, entre los más recientes, Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola o Steven Spielberg. Actores estadounidenses como Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne o Marilyn Monroe se han convertido en figuras icónicas, mientras que el productor y empresario Walt Disney fue uno de los líderes en la animación y el merchandising de sus películas. Los estudios de cine más importantes de Hollywood han producido las películas comercialmente más exitosas en la historia, tales como Star Wars (1977), Titanic (1997) o Avatar (2009). Para la década de 2020, los productos de Hollywood continuarán dominando la industria cinematográfica a nivel mundial.[246]​\n\nCon la historieta, la producción estadounidense ha perdido el liderazgo que ostentaba a nivel mundial desde principios del siglo XX, destacando varias tiras de prensa como Flash Gordon, The Phantom o El Príncipe Valiente. Luego de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el cómic se convirtió en un medio minoritario que recientemente vive el fenómeno de la novela gráfica, en el que destacan autores como Charles Burns, Joe Sacco o Chris Ware. No obstante, las tiras cómicas y las historietas también son parte del legado artístico del país. Por ejemplo, Superman, uno de los superhéroes más conocidos dentro de este medio, se ha convertido en todo un ícono nacional. ​\n\nEstados Unidos tiene la mayor cantidad de televidentes en el mundo,[248]​ a la vez que el promedio de tiempo dedicado a ella sigue en aumento, llegando a cinco horas al día en 2006.[249]​ Las cuatro cadenas de televisión más importantes son todas entidades comerciales. Los estadounidenses también escuchan programas de radio, en gran medida comercializados, en promedio durante dos y media horas al día.[250]​ Los sitios web y motores de búsqueda más populares de la red son inventiva estadounidense, incluidos Google, Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Blogger, eBay y Yahoo!.[251]​\n\nEn cuanto a la música, la obra de Charles Ives de la década de 1910, en gran parte ignorada durante su desarrollo, lo llevó a convertirse en el primer compositor de música clásica estadounidense exitoso; otros pioneros como Henry Cowell y John Cage crearon un enfoque estadounidense dentro de las composiciones clásicas. Aaron Copland y George Gershwin desarrollaron una mezcla única de música clásica con música popular.\n\nLos estilos rítmicos y líricos de la música afroamericana han influido profundamente en la música de Estados Unidos en general, distinguiéndola de las tradiciones europeas. Elementos de la música folclórica, como el blues y lo que ahora se conoce como old music fueron adaptados y transformados en géneros populares para una audiencia global. El jazz fue desarrollado por artistas innovadores tales como Louis Armstrong y Duke Ellington a principios del siglo XX. El country surgió en la década de 1920 y el rhythm and blues en la década de 1940. A mediados de la siguiente década, Elvis Presley y Chuck Berry estuvieron entre los pioneros del rock and roll. En la década de 1960, el surgimiento de la carrera de Bob Dylan ayudó a revivir la influencia de la música folclórica, para convertirse en uno de los compositores más célebres del país; al mismo tiempo, James Brown lideró el desarrollo del funk. Las más recientes creaciones estadounidenses incluyen el hip hop y la música house. Finalmente, estrellas de la música popular estadounidense como Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift e Eminem se han convertido en celebridades mundiales. ​\n\nDurante el siglo XVIII y principios del siglo XIX, la literatura estadunidense tomaba la mayoría de sus influencias de Europa. A mediados del siglo XIX, escritores como Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe y Henry David Thoreau establecieron una literatura propia del país. Mark Twain y el poeta Walt Whitman fueron dos de las grandes figuras de la segunda mitad del siglo; Emily Dickinson, virtualmente desconocida durante su vida, también es considerada como una de las poetisas más importantes de la literatura estadounidense. ​ Una obra que captura aspectos fundamentales de la vida en el país en sus personajes ―tales como Moby-Dick (1851) de Herman Melville, Las aventuras de Huckleberry Finn (1885) de Mark Twain y El gran Gatsby (1925) de F. Scott Fitzgerald― puede ser considerada como la «gran novela estadounidense».\n\nOnce ciudadanos estadounidenses han ganado el Premio Nobel de Literatura, siendo el más reciente Toni Morrison en 1993. William Faulkner y Ernest Hemingway, ganadores en los años 1949 y 1954, respectivamente, a menudo son catalogados entre los escritores más influyentes del siglo XX. ​ Varios géneros literarios populares como los del viejo oeste y la novela negra se desarrollaron en el país. Los escritores de la generación beat (Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs…) abrieron el campo a nuevas formas literarias, así como a autores posmodernistas como John Barth, Thomas Pynchon y Don DeLillo. Merece la pena mencionar asimismo a otros poetas y escritores tan importantes como Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, el nacionalizado Vladimir Nabokov, Raymond Carver, y, dentro de la literatura fantástica, son de renombre internacional H. P. Lovecraft, Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, etc.\n\nEn el campo de la filosofía, los trascendentalistas, liderados por Henry Thoreau y Ralph Waldo Emerson, establecieron el primer movimiento filosófico importante del país. Después de la Guerra de Secesión, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James y John Dewey fueron los líderes del desarrollo del pragmatismo. En el siglo XX, las obras de W. V. O. Quine, Richard Rorty y Noam Chomsky, trajeron la filosofía analítica a las academias estadounidenses. En décadas más recientes, John Rawls y Robert Nozick fueron dos de los líderes más importantes del resurgimiento de la filosofía política.\n\nLa gastronomía de Estados Unidos es similar a la de otros países occidentales, con el trigo siendo el cereal más utilizado. La cocina tradicional estadunidense utiliza ingredientes como el pavo, carne de ciervo, papas, camotes, maíz, calabazas, miel de maple y otros elementos indígenas utilizados por los amerindios y los primeros colonizadores europeos. Parrilladas de puerco y res, tortas de cangrejo, papas chips y las galletas con chispas de chocolate son algunos de los platos hechos al «estilo estadounidense». La soul food, la cocina tradicional de los esclavos africanos, es aún popular en el sur y entre los afroamericanos de otras partes del país. Las gastronomías sincréticas, como la cocina criolla de Luisiana, la cajún y la tex-mex, tienen gran importancia regional.\n\nPlatos característicos como la tarta de manzana, el pollo frito, la pizza, la hamburguesa y el perrito caliente provienen de recetas introducidas por los inmigrantes. Las papas fritas, los platillos mexicanos como los burritos y tacos y los platillos con pastas adaptados de recetas italianas también son ampliamente consumidos.[255]​ En el consumo de bebidas, los estadounidenses prefieren el café en vez del té. La publicidad de las industrias estadounidenses ha hecho que el jugo de naranja y la leche sean las bebidas típicas de un desayuno. ​ ​ El consumo frecuente de comida rápida está asociado con lo que los médicos llaman «epidemia de obesidad». Las gaseosas son ampliamente populares: el azúcar contenido en ellas aporta el 9 % de la ingesta calórica promedio.[258]​[259]​\n\nEstados Unidos es pionero en la investigación científica y la innovación tecnológica desde el siglo XIX. En 1876, Alexander Graham Bell recibió la primera patente para un estadounidense por el teléfono.[260]​ El laboratorio de Thomas Edison desarrolló el fonógrafo, la primera lámpara incandescente y el primer proyector de películas. Nikola Tesla fue precursor en experimentar con la corriente alterna, el motor de corriente alterna y la radio. En el siglo XX, las compañías de automóviles de Ransom Eli Olds y Henry Ford promovieron la producción en cadena. En 1903, los hermanos Wright realizaron el primer vuelo propulsado en su aeronave Wright Flyer.[261]​\n\nEl ascenso del nazismo en la década de 1930 llevó a muchos científicos europeos, incluyendo a Albert Einstein y Enrico Fermi, a emigrar al país. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el proyecto Manhattan ya había desarrollado las primeras armas nucleares, anunciando el inicio de la era nuclear. La carrera espacial también produjo avances rápidos en la construcción y el desarrollo de cohetes, la ciencia de materiales y la informática. El país fue responsable del desarrollo de la ARPANET y su sucesor, Internet. Hoy en día, la mayor parte de los ingresos para la investigación y desarrollo, un 64%, provienen del sector privado.[262]​ El país es líder mundial en publicaciones de investigación científica y en el factor de impacto.[263]​ Los estadounidenses poseen bienes de consumo tecnológicamente avanzados[264]​[265]​[266]​ y casi la mitad de los hogares tienen acceso a Internet de banda ancha.[267]​ También es el principal desarrollador y cultivador de organismos genéticamente modificados; más de la mitad de las tierras con cultivos biotecnológicos del mundo se encuentran en Estados Unidos.[268]​\n\nSegún el Índice Mundial de Innovación, a cargo de la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual, en su versión 2024, Estados Unidos se ubica en el tercer lugar de dicho índice.[269]​ Desde 2023, fue desplazado del segundo lugar que ocupó en 2022, por Suecia.[270]​ [271]​[272]​ En ediciones anteriores a 2022, de este índice, Estados Unidos obtuvo la posición número 3, en los cuales el primer lugar ha sido siempre ocupado por Suiza.[273]​[274]​\n\nDesde finales del siglo XIX, el béisbol se considera como el deporte nacional, mientras que el fútbol americano, el baloncesto y el hockey sobre hielo son los otros tres grandes deportes de conjunto a nivel profesional. Las ligas universitarias también atraen a grandes audiencias. El fútbol americano es el deporte más popular en Estados Unidos.[276]​[277]​ El boxeo y las carreras de caballos fueron en su momento los deportes individuales más vistos, pero han sido eclipsados por el golf y el automovilismo, particularmente por los campeonatos Stock Cars como la más importante Copa NASCAR y otras categorías nacionales y regionales de NASCAR y ARCA. Otros campeonatos de monoplazas reseñables son la IndyCar, anteriormente la desaparecida Championship Auto Racing Teams y las carreras de resistencia como la United SportsCar Championship. Una de las principales carreras de Estados Unidos son las 500 Millas de Indianapolis de la IndyCar, que cuenta con prestigio internacional. Las carreras de resistencia como las 24 Horas de Daytona, 12 Horas de Sebring y la Petit Le Mans son de igual importancia en el automovilismo mundial. Las 500 millas de Daytona de la copa NASCAR es la carrera más importante de los Stock Cars del mundo. El fútbol, aunque no es uno de los principales deportes a nivel profesional en el país, tiene gran presencia y nivel de aficionados. El tenis y otros deportes de exterior también son populares junto al Abierto de Estados Unidos, uno de los campeonatos de tenis más vistos del mundo.\n\nSi bien la mayoría de los deportes importantes de los Estados Unidos han evolucionado de prácticas europeas, el baloncesto, el voleibol, la animación y el snowboarding son invenciones locales. El lacrosse y el surf surgieron de los amerindios y de los nativos de Hawái.\n\nEl Comité Olímpico de los Estados Unidos (USOC) fue anfitrión de los Juegos Olímpicos de Verano en cuatro ocasiones: San Luis 1904, Los Ángeles 1932, Los Ángeles 1984 y Atlanta 1996, y de los Juegos de Invierno en cuatro ocasiones: Lake Placid 1932, Squaw Valley 1960, Lake Placid 1980 y Salt Lake City 2002.[278]​ Estados Unidos organizará los juegos de verano de 2028 en Los Ángeles y los de invierno de 2034 en Salt Lake City. Estados Unidos ha ganado 2781 medallas en los Juegos Olímpicos de Verano, más que ningún otro país y 330 medallas en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno.[279]​\n• Anexo:Patrimonio de la Humanidad en Estados Unidos\n• Anexo:Banderas de los Estados Unidos de América\n• Anexo:Presidentes de los Estados Unidos\n• Estado de los Estados Unidos de América\n• Medios de comunicación en Estados Unidos\n• None .

Directly north of Pasadena, it is located approximately 14 miles (23 km) from Downtown Los Angeles. Its population was 42,846 at the 2020 census, up slightly from a 2010 figure of 42,777. In early 2025, the community was impacted by the Eaton Fire.\n\nThe name Altadena was coined from the Spanish alta, meaning \"upper\", and dena from Pasadena; the area is adjacent to, but at a higher elevation than, Pasadena.[6][7]\n\nIn the mid-1860s, Benjamin S. Eaton first developed water sources from the Arroyo Seco and Eaton Canyon to irrigate his vineyard near the edge of Eaton Canyon. This made possible the development of Altadena, Pasadena, and South Pasadena. He did the construction for B. D. Wilson and Dr. John Griffin, who jointly owned the Mexican land grant of Rancho San Pascual, about 14,000 acres (5,700 ha), that would be the future sites of these three communities. They hoped to develop and sell this land in a real estate plan called the San Pasqual Plantation. Their efforts failed by 1870, despite Eaton's irrigation ditch that drew water from the site of present-day Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the Arroyo Seco, because the land was relatively inaccessible and few believed crops could thrive that close to the mountains.\n\nEaton tried to sell the land for the partners, and in late 1873 he helped broker a deal with Daniel Berry, who represented a group of investors from Indiana, to buy 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) of the rancho. This included the land of present-day Altadena, but they developed a 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) section further south as Pasadena.\n\nByron O. Clark established a nursery in the foothills in 1875, which he named \"Altadena Nursery\", a name he coined from the Spanish alta meaning \"upper\" and dena from Pasadena.\n\nIn 1880 or 1881, Capt. Frederick Woodbury, and his brother, John Woodbury of Marshalltown, Iowa, purchased 937 acres (379 ha) known as the Woodbury Ranch. The land remained primarily agricultural, though several Eastern millionaires built mansions along Mariposa Street, and a small community developed through the 1890s and into the next century.\n\nJohn Woodbury established the Pasadena Improvement Company in 1887, with a plot plan of residential development referred to as the Woodbury Subdivision. They contacted Byron O. Clark, who had moved away, and asked if he could use the name \"Altadena\" for his subdivision; Clark agreed.\n\nThe newly-sprouted community of Altadena immediately began to attract millionaires from the East. In 1887 Andrew McNally, the printing magnate from Chicago, and his friend, George Gill Green, had built mansions on what was to become Millionaire's Row: Mariposa Street near Santa Rosa Avenue. Newspaper moguls William Armiger Scripps and William Kellogg built homes side by side just east of Fair Oaks Avenue. A bit farther east, Zane Grey bought a home from Arthur Herbert Woodward, and added a second-floor study. The famous Benziger Publishing Company built a mansion on the corner of Santa Rosa Avenue (Christmas Tree Lane) and Mariposa. Mariposa was taken from the Spanish name for a butterfly. The grandson of Andrew McNally, Wallace Neff, became a famous Southern California architect. He started his career in Altadena with the design and construction of St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church (parish est. 1918), which was dedicated in October 1926.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1926, 160 homes were built in Altadena by fugitive conman Elisha Paul Janes, with distinctive steep roofs and multiple gables; despite his lack of qualifications, they proved popular, and this neighbourhood was designated as a heritage area in 2002.[8][9] Many notable buildings followed in the 1930s, including Eliot Junior High School (1931) and Davies Community Center in Farnsworth Park (1934).[10]\n\nRedlining policies prevented African Americans from acquiring land or purchasing property in much of California.[11][12] One of the areas exempt from these policies was Altadena Meadows, which thrived and became one of first middle-class African American neighborhoods in the area.[12][13]\n\nWhile Altadena long refused wholesale annexation by neighboring Pasadena, the larger community nibbled at its edges in several small annexations of neighborhoods through the 1940s. Attempted annexation was stopped in 1956 by community campaigns, though it has been resurrected several times since by Pasadena without success. Had the annexation succeeded, Pasadena would be the 108th largest city in the United States.\n\nWith early-1960s redevelopment in Pasadena, the routing of extensions of the 134 and 210 freeways, and lawsuits over the desegregation of Pasadena Unified School District, there was white flight and convulsive racial change in Altadena. In 1960, its black population was under four percent; over the next 15 years, half the White population left, and was replaced by people of color, many of whom settled on the west side of town after being displaced by Pasadena's redevelopment and freeway projects.\n\nIn 1993, the Kinneloa Fire, begun accidentally on the slopes above Eaton Canyon, burned dozens of homes in Altadena and neighboring Kinneloa Mesa as part of a rash of late October wildfires driven by Santa Ana winds in Southern California. One man died of complications from smoke inhalation and dozens were injured.[14][15]\n\nIn 2022, Altadena gained local coverage in Los Angeles as the place of the first land return to the Tongva since the arrival of Europeans in the Los Angeles Basin area, after a resident donated her 1 acre property to the Tongva Taraxat Paxaavxa Conservancy.[16][17] It was described as marking the first time in nearly 200 years that the Tongva have had land in Los Angeles County.[18]\n\nIn 2022 Altadena gained national media coverage, as it was the location where a single lottery ticket was sold to Edwin Castro, which would win a world record US$2.04 billion Powerball jackpot.[19]\n\nOn January 7, 2025, the Eaton Fire started in Altadena around 6:30 PM local time. It quickly spread to 14,000 acres by January 10, with 5 confirmed fatalities. Over 7,000 structures were damaged or destroyed, including the Andrew McNally House, Altadena Community Church, St. Mark's Episcopal Church, The Bunny Museum, Scripps Hall and much of the downtown area. The entirety of Altadena was put under an evacuation order.[20]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 8.7 square miles (23 km2), over 99% of it land.\n\nAltadena experiences hot and dry summers that are followed by warm and windy falls and mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Altadena has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated Csa on climate maps.\n\nThe wettest calendar year was 1983, with 48.47 inches (1,231.1 mm), and the driest was 1947, with 5.37 inches (136.4 mm). The most rainfall in one month was 19.70 inches (500.4 mm), in February 1980. The most rainfall in 24 hours was 7.70 inches (195.6 mm), on March 2, 1938. Altadena averages 21.09 inches (535.7 mm) of rain a year, over 6 inches (150 mm) more than nearby Los Angeles due to the orographic effect created by the San Gabriel Mountains. Because of the slope on which the city is built, sewer lines in the city's northern section have been known to overflow significantly.[citation needed]\n\nAltadena first appeared as an unincorporated community in the 1960 U.S. Census;[33] and as a census-designated place in the 1980 U.S. Census.[35]\n\nThe 2020 United States census[42] reported that Altadena had a population of 42,846. The racial makeup of Altadena in the year 2020 was (53.2%) White (41.2% Non-Hispanic White),[43] (19.7%) African American, (0.6%) Native American, (5.2%) Asian, (0.1%) Pacific Islander, and (6.9%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 29.5% of the population.\n\nThe 2010 United States census[44] reported that Altadena had a population of 42,777. The population density was 4,900.4 inhabitants per square mile (1,892.1/km2). The racial makeup of Altadena in the year 2010 was 22,569 (52.8%) White (40.3% Non-Hispanic White),[43] 10,136 (23.7%) African American, 300 (0.7%) Native American, 2,307 (5.4%) Asian, 71 (0.2%) Pacific Islander, 4,852 (11.3%) from other races, and 2,542 (5.9%) from two or more races. There were 11,502 Hispanic or Latino residents, of any race (26.9%).\n\nThe Census reported that 42,276 people (98.8% of the population) lived in households, 234 (0.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 267 (0.6%) were institutionalized.\n\nThere were 15,212 households, out of which 5,170 (34.0%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 7,684 (50.5%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 2,210 (14.5%) had a female householder with no husband present, 814 (5.4%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 661 (4.3%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 271 (1.8%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 3,489 households (22.9%) were made up of individuals, and 1,318 (8.7%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.78. There were 10,708 families (70.4% of all households); the average family size was 3.26.\n\nThe age distribution of the city's population was as follows: 9,507 people (22.2%) were under the age of 18, 3,286 (7.7%) aged 18 to 24, 10,622 (24.8%) aged 25 to 44, 13,298 (31.1%) aged 45 to 64, and 6,064 (14.2%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.2 males.\n\nThere were 15,947 housing units at an average density of 1,826.8 per square mile (705.3/km2), of which 10,889 (71.6%) were owner-occupied, and 4,323 (28.4%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 0.9%; the rental vacancy rate was 4.9%. 30,319 people (70.9% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 11,957 people (28.0%) lived in rental housing units.\n\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Altadena had a median household income of $82,895, with 10.7% of the population living below the federal poverty line.[43]\n\nAs of the 2000 United States census,[45] there were 42,610 people, 14,780 households, and 10,671 families residing in the CDP.

He represented their C team after being loaned to CD Onda for one year.[2]\n\nIn the summer of 2013, after brief spells with CD El Palo[3] and Huracán Valencia CF,[4] Doménech signed for Valencia CF, and was assigned to the reserves in the Segunda División B.[5] In both of his seasons, the side narrowly avoided relegation with him as first choice.[6]\n\nDoménech was promoted to the main squad for the 2015–16 campaign by manager Nuno Espírito Santo. On 12 September, profiting from injuries to both Diego Alves and Mathew Ryan, he played his first match in La Liga, a 1–0 away win against Sporting de Gijón where he put in a player of the match performance.[7][8] The following day, the club announced he had renewed his contract until 2018.[9]\n\nDoménech was backup to another Brazilian, Neto, in 2017–18. He started in the team's semi-final run in the Copa del Rey, notably saving two penalties in the shootout against Deportivo Alavés in the quarter-finals.[10][11] In the following edition of the tournament he appeared in every game for the winners,[12] including the 2–1 victory over FC Barcelona in the final.[13] On 18 May 2019, he made a rare league appearance on the last day of the season away to Real Valladolid, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win to qualify for the UEFA Champions League.[14]\n\nDoménech signed new contracts in September 2016[15] and November 2019, tying him to Valencia until 2023 and enacting a buyout clause of €50 million.[16] In the summer of 2020, the club wanted to offload his competitor Jasper Cillessen due to financial problems but this never transpired;[17] nonetheless, in the ensuing season he played the majority of league games for the first time due to the Dutchman's injuries.[18]\n\nThird-choice to new signing Giorgi Mamardashvili and Cillessen during the 2021–22 campaign, Doménech became a backup after the latter left, but suffered a serious knee injury on 8 September 2022.[19] The following day, he further extended his contract until 2025.[20]Jaume Doménech - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Jaume Domènech Sánchez (Almenara, Castellón, 5 de noviembre de 1990) es un futbolista español que juega como portero en el Valencia C. F. de la Primera División de España.\n\nSu primer entrenador fue el exdelantero José Vicente Forment en la U.D. Almenara,[2]​ y luego pasó a las categorías inferiores del Villarreal Club de Fútbol. Estuvo en el equipo Juvenil A, luego cedido al C.D. Onda y finalmente jugó en el Villarreal \"C\" y alguna participación en el Villarreal \"B\".[3]​\n\nEn 2012 deja el Villarreal y ficha por el C.D. El Palo, de la Tercera División malagueña. El equipo no conoció la derrota mientras Jaume defendió la portería en la primera parte de la temporada 2012/13, 14 partidos consecutivos, pero en el mercado invernal, le llegó la oportunidad de volver a tierras valencianas cuando recibió la llamada del club Huracán Valencia de la Segunda División B.[4]​ En el equipo valenciano no gozó de todo el protagonismo que le habría gustado, pero el equipo estuvo cerca de ascender de categoría.\n\nEn verano de 2013 le llegó la llamada del Valencia Mestalla, por petición expresa del que fuera su técnico en el Huracán Valencia y nuevo técnico del filial valencianista, Nico Estévez.[5]​ Llegó a priori para ser el suplente de Yeray Gómez, pero se hizo rápidamente con la titularidad. Lesiones puntuales de los porteros del primer equipo, Guaita y Alves, hacían que fuese convocado con el primer equipo valencianista pero sin llegar a debutar.[6]​\n\nEn 2014, con la salida de Guaita, hizo la pretemporada con el primer equipo y dejó unas excelentes sensaciones en técnicos y aficionados, pero el club decidió incorporar a un portero con experiencia en Primera División como Yoel Rodríguez del Celta. Este hecho mantuvo a Jaume como tercer portero del primer equipo, pero disputando los partidos con el Valencia Mestalla en Segunda B. En octubre sufrió una desafortunada lesión que le hizo perder un mes de competición,[7]​ y luego otro susto a finales de noviembre.[8]​ Esto provocó que la titularidad pasara a Álex Sánchez, pero poco después recuperó la titularidad ya para todo el último tercio de la temporada.\n\nEl verano de 2015 fue el más decisivo en su carrera, ya que le quedaba un año de contrato con el club, y además por edad (24 años) la normativa le impedía compaginar convocatorias con el primer equipo y jugar partidos con el filial. Tanto el club como Jaume debían tomar una decisión. La grave lesión de Diego Alves en mayo hizo que el club decidiera reforzar la portería con el australiano Ryan, pero aun así el club debía escoger entre Jaume o Yoel.\n\nEl técnico Nuno convenció a Jaume para que no se marchara, a pesar de tener ofertas en Segunda División,[9]​ y la idea era dar salida a Yoel, pero una inesperada lesión de Ryan hizo que finalmente el Valencia Club de Fútbol se quedara con los tres porteros en el primer equipo para tener guardametas de garantías.\n\nLa elección del portero titular fue difícil, porque Nuno debía elegir entre la energía y las ganas de Jaume o la experiencia de Yoel, pero finalmente apostó por Jaume como titular y debutó el 12 de septiembre de 2015 en El Molinón en la 3.ª jornada de Liga. El resultado final fue de victoria valencianista por 0-1 con gol de Paco Alcácer en el minuto 91, y la actuación de Jaume Domènech fue estelar y clave para que el equipo no encajara ningún gol.[10]​ Justo al día siguiente se anunció oficialmente la renovación del contrato de Jaume con el club, hasta el año 2018 con una cláusula de rescisión de 30 millones de euros,[11]​ aunque el acuerdo ya estaba cerrado desde que Nuno convenciera al jugador para quedarse. Tres días después debutó como titular en Mestalla en la primera jornada de la Liga de Campeones frente al Zenit, con peor fortuna al caer derrotado el equipo por 2-3,[12]​ pero en los siguientes partidos volvió a ser el héroe del equipo realizando paradas espectaculares frente al Granada[13]​ y al Olympique de Lyon.[14]​\n\nContinuó con la titularidad mientras se alargaba la lesión de Ryan,[15]​ y detuvo su primer penal en la 8.ª jornada al especialista del Málaga, Duda,[16]​ jugada que el público de Mestalla celebró como si de un gol se tratase. La conexión entre Jaume y la grada era magnífica y, tras la salida de Yoel al Rayo y la recuperación de Ryan, siguió Jaume siendo el titular indiscutible y mejor jugador de la irregular campaña valencianista, salvando muchos puntos al equipo y llegando a ser a finales de noviembre el mejor portero de la Liga en porcentaje de paradas en aquel momento, por delante de Bravo.[17]​[18]​ Inexplicablemente Nuno le quitó la titularidad en la 13.ª jornada en el Sánchez Pizjuán, pero el siguiente partido volvió al once frente al Barcelona con Voro en el banquillo.\n\nEn la 15.ª jornada, en el debut liguero de Gary Neville, volvió a salvar al equipo, esta vez en Ipurúa, con grandes paradas y al final deteniendo su segundo penal de la temporada , y esta vez detuvo el lanzamiento al delantero Saúl Berjón.[19]​ Al finalizar la primera vuelta, la LFP lo consideró el portero protagonista de todo el campeonato durante las primeras 19 jornadas, considerándolo uno de los porteros más prometedores de la liga y destacando sus brillantes actuaciones, sus reflejos y su capacidad para detener penales en momentos comprometidos.[20]​ Aun así, tras la 19.ª jornada, la titularidad tanto en Liga como en Copa pasó a Maty Ryan por decisión de Gary Neville tras una floja actuación de Jaume en Anoeta, una decisión discutida aunque acompañada también de grandes actuaciones del portero australiano. Tras el mercado de invierno cambió su dorsal 24 por el 13 (que había dejado libre Yoel), ya que el 24 pasó a la nueva incorporación de Cheryshev. En la segunda vuelta de la temporada, con la recuperación del brasileño Diego Alves, no disputó ningún minuto hasta la última jornada contra la Real Sociedad en Mestalla y la vuelta de las semifinales de Copa, en ambos casos sin nada en juego.\n\nEn verano de 2016 fue uno de los futbolistas que el club más utilizabá como imagen a nivel local e internacional, como demuestra su viaje a Singapur junto a otros compañeros,[21]​ dando abiertamente su opinión sobre Lim.[22]​ El club barajaba el posible traspaso de Diego Alves para mantener en la portería a Jaume y Ryan, pero finalmente el brasileño siguió en el equipo y fue el portero titular. A pesar de ello el club mostró su confianza en Jaume renovando de nuevo su contrato, esta vez hasta 2022,[23]​ y el australiano Ryan, con además problemas físicos, pasó a ser el tercer portero y en el mercado de invierno salió cedido. El 28 de octubre hizo de anfitrión en Almenara en un encuentro entre siete jugadores de la plantilla, exfutbolistas y peñistas con niños y vecinos de la localidad.[24]​ En liga fue suplente de Alves para todos los técnicos durante la temporada, y fue el portero titular en las dos eliminatorias de Copa.\n\nEn la temporada 2017-18 el club incorporó al brasileño Neto y traspasó a Alves, Ryan y Sivera, con lo que Jaume se quedó como segundo portero para el técnico Marcelino García Toral y siendo uno de los capitanes de la plantilla tras Parejo, Rodrigo y Gayà. Disputó solo un partido de liga pero todas las eliminatorias de la Copa del Rey hasta las semifinales, siendo capitán del equipo en los últimos minutos del partido de vuelta frente al Real Zaragoza y en los dos encuentros frente a Las Palmas. Fue el protagonista en la decisiva eliminatoria de cuartos de final frente al Deportivo Alavés, que se decidió en la tanda de penales y logró detener dos disparos.[25]​\n\nLa temporada 2018-19 fue muy especial para Jaume. Siguió siendo el portero suplente de Neto pero fue el titular en todos los partidos de la Copa del Rey, llegando incluso hasta la final en la que el equipo se proclamó campeón del torneo el 25 de mayo de 2019 en el estadio Benito Villamarín, logrando así su primer título ganando 2-1 al Barcelona.[26]​ Además se confirmó como uno de los pesos pesados de la plantilla siendo por ejemplo el representante de los jugadores en actos del centenario del club como la marcha que tuvo lugar el 18 de marzo de 2019.[27]​\n\nLos problemas de Neto con el técnico Marcelino[28]​ hicieron que el brasileño fuese traspasado y llegase el holandés Cillessen con la presumible titularidad. Con Albert Celades de técnico en la temporada 2019-20 parte como suplente, pero los problemas físicos de Cillessen le dan opción de jugar a principios de diciembre,[29]​ y se alzó con la titularidad incluso tras la recuperación del holandés, pasando a ser titular durante nueve jornadas consecutivas, participando también en la Supercopa,[30]​ y en la Copa, siendo el salvador del equipo de nuevo en una tanda de penaltis.[31]​ También participó en dos partidos de Champions,[32]​ lo que supuso un total de 21 partidos disputados a lo largo de la temporada, una cifra muy cercana a los 24 encuentros que disputó en su temporada de debut 2015-16.\n\nLa 2020-21 fue una temporada en la que el club necesitaba traspasar a los futbolistas con mayor peso económico en la plantilla y uno de ellos era Cillessen,[33]​ que además no había mostrado su mejor versión en Valencia, pero finalmente el neerlandés siguió en el equipo pero sin contar demasiado para el técnico Javi Gracia, con lo que Jaume se hizo con la titularidad indiscutible para el entrenador. Además los traspasos de Parejo, Rodrigo y Kondogbia, tres de los capitanes, hicieron al portero convertirse en el 2.º capitán del equipo por detrás de José Luis Gayà.[34]​ Tras dos meses de titulariad de Jaume hubo dudas entre la afición y la prensa sobre la idoneidad de la titularidad de Jaume,[35]​ pero justo cuando Cillessen iba a tener su oportunidad sufrió una grave lesión,[36]​ lo cual hizo mantener la titularidad a Jaume en todos los encuentros y empezar a salvar el resultado en varios encuentros con sus paradas.[37]​ Llegó a participar en un total de 27 partidos, por tanto se convirtió en la temporada en la que más partidos disputó con el equipo.\n\nEn la temporada 2021-22, a las órdenes del técnico José Bordalás, llegó a la plantilla un joven portero que llegaba para el equipo filial, Giorgi Mamardashvili, pero sorprendió a todos con su magnífico rendimiento y se quedó en el primer equipo disputando la titularidad a Cillessen. Jaume siguió siendo uno de los capitanes junto a Gayà y Carlos Soler, pero solo disputó las cinco primeras eliminatorias de la Copa del Rey.

Son bourg est à 5,5 au nord-ouest de Tessy-sur-Vire, à 8,5 au sud-ouest de Condé-sur-Vire et à 12 au sud de Saint-Lô[1].\n\nLe territoire est traversé du nord au sud par la route départementale 28 qui passe par le bourg et mène à Tessy-sur-Vire au sud et à Saint-Romphaire et Saint-Lô au nord. La D 77 permet de rejoindre Saint-Samson-de-Bonfossé au nord-ouest et la D 396 Troisgots à l'est. L'accès à l'A84 (sortie 39) est situé à 10 au sud, par Tessy-sur-Vire.\n\nLe Mesnil-Opac est dans le bassin de la Vire, par ses sous-affluents le ruisseau de Dillon, qui délimite le territoire à l'ouest, et le ruisseau de Bricqueville le limitant à l'est. Ces deux ruisseaux rejoignent le Marqueran sur la commune voisine, Moyon, rivière qui conflue avec la Vire entre Fervaches et Troisgots. Les hauteurs entre les deux vallons, sur lesquelles est situé le bourg, sont parcourues par la route départementale 77.\n\nLe point culminant (161 ) se situe au nord-ouest, près du lieu-dit la Héroudière. Le point le plus bas (65 ) correspond à la sortie du ruisseau du Dillon du territoire, au sud. La commune est bocagère.\n\nLe climat est océanique, comme dans tout l'Ouest de la France. La station météorologique la plus proche est Granville-Pointe du Roc, à 40 , mais Caen-Carpiquet est à près de 50 [2]. Le Pays saint-lois s'en différencie toutefois pour la pluviométrie annuelle qui, au Mesnil-Opac, avoisine les 1 000 [3].\n\nLes lieux-dits sont, du nord-ouest à l'ouest, dans le sens horaire : la Riquerie, la Carbonnerie, les Noës, le Crespin, la Hédouvière, la Fosse Fouquet, les Champins, le Pivelet (au nord), la Tringale, le Petit Bricqueville, la Morandière, la Lande, le Grand Bricqueville, le Bourg (à l'est), la Faverie, Bonne Louise, les Hayes, la Perette, le Brisault, le Champ Hue (au sud), les Vaux, la Tosnardière, le Dillon, le Champ Pommier, le Beaussemay, le Hamel Gosselin (à l'ouest), la Maison Neuve et le Bouessais[4].\n\nLe nom de la localité est attesté sous les formes latinisées Maisnillo Ospac en 1180 - 1189[6] ou Mesnillo Ospac en 1180[7] et Maisnillum Ospac en 1180-1189[8],[6].\n\nIl s'agit d'une formation toponymique médiévale en Mesnil-, appellatif toponymique caractéristique du nord de la France, dont la forme primitive est Maisnil, d'où les attestations anciennes en Maisnil-. Il est issu ultimement du gallo-roman *MASIONILE, c'est-à-dire bas latin ma(n)sion- « séjour, lieu de séjour, habitation, demeure, auberge » (de manere « rester, demeurer », v. manoir) qui n'existe au sens de « maison » qu'en gallo-roman et dans les parlers septentrionaux (cf. maison), il est suivi du suffixe -ile[9].\n\nLe second élément -Opac représente l'anthroponyme norrois Ospakr[8],[6] (souvent latinisé en Ospachus[7] dans les textes écrits en latin médiéval). En vieux norrois, ce nom de personne est plus précisément noté Óspakr ou ÓspakR[10]. Il remonte au mot úspakr qui signifie « sauvage, indiscipliné, tête brûlée », composé des éléments u-, préfixe négatif (correspondant à l'anglais et à l'allemand un-), suivi de spak « sensé, sage »[10]. L'anthroponyme Ospac est exceptionnel dans la toponymie normande.\n\nBricqueville appartient à la série des Bricqueville normands, formation toponymique médiévale commune en Normandie occidentale cf. Bricqueville-la-Blouette, Briccavilla 1080, Briquevilla 1200; Bricqueville-sur-Mer, Briquevilla 1022 - 1026[11], plus rare en Normandie orientale, dont le premier élément est Brique- ou Bricque- et le second élément -ville appellatif toponymique répandu notamment en Normandie où il avait généralement le sens de « domaine rural ». L'élément précédent l'appellatif -ville est généralement un anthroponyme et Il semble que les Bricqueville / Briqueville soient typiquement normands, c'est pourquoi Jean Adigard des Gautries préfère avoir recours au nom de personne anglo-scandinave Briki[11], en réalité *Briki, anthroponyme hypothétique qui serait contenu dans certains toponymes danois[12].\n\nLes hameaux en Y-ère/-erie sont des habitats ultérieurs, résultant du développement démographique de la Normandie. Ils désignaient la ferme de la famille Y, fondée sur les nouvelles terres obtenues par les grands défrichements des – siècle. Les essarts prennent le nom des propriétaires qui s'installent sur ces terres, suivi du suffixe -erie ou -ière[13]. Les autres hameaux en Hôtel / Le / Maison…Y sont des constructions encore plus tardives, ils désignent la propriété de la famille Y.\n\nUn Gérard et Bernard d'Opac, les premiers connus de la famille qui donna son nom à la commune, sont cités dans une charte de 1027[14] concernant une donation à l'abbaye de Fécamp[15].\n\nSous l'Ancien Régime, la paroisse dépendait de la généralité de Caen, de l'élection de Coutances (en 1612/1636 et 1677) puis de Saint-Lô (en 1713), et de la sergenterie de Moyon. Depuis 1689, la paroisse accueillait le pèlerinage Saint-Vincent pour les maladies des animaux[15].\n\nEn 1944, le village fut presque entièrement détruit[15].\n\nLe , Le Mesnil-Opac intègre avec Moyon et Chevry la commune de Moyon Villages[16] créée sous le régime juridique des communes nouvelles instauré par la loi 2010-1563 du de réforme des collectivités territoriales. Les communes du Mesnil-Opac, Chevry et Moyon deviennent des communes déléguées. Moyon est le chef-lieu de la commune nouvelle.\n\nLe , le territoire diminue légèrement avec un transfert de territoire vers la commune du Mesnil-Herman par décret du conseil d'État du [17] afin d'obtenir une continuité territoriale entre cette dernière et la commune de Moyon Villages dans le but d'intégrer cette commune nouvelle. La commune du Mesnil-Opac n'est plus alors limitrophe de Saint-Martin-de-Bonfossé.\n\nLe conseil municipal était composé de huit membres (pour onze sièges) dont le maire et trois adjoints[21]. Ces conseillers intègrent au complet le conseil municipal de Moyon-Villages le jusqu'en 2020 et Isabelle Fleury devient maire délégué.\n\nLes élections de 2014 engendre un certain remous au sein de la commune. En effet, à la suite du scrutin national, le maire sortant Michel Desvages est élu conseiller municipal mais battu par Guy Lefranc lors du vote pour le poste de maire. Ce dernier démissionne du poste de maire deux mois plus tard et son adjointe quitte le conseil, ce qui a pour effet de provoquer une nouvelle répartition du nombre de délégués communautaire au sein de Saint-Lô Agglo. Lors des municipales partielles qui se déroulent en octobre, Isabelle Fleury est élue au conseil, avant de remporter, la semaine suivante, l'élection du maire, devant Michel Desvages ; l'ancien maire et deux autres conseillers démissionnent alors du conseil[21].\n\nEn 2021, la commune comptait 246 habitants. Depuis 2004, les enquêtes de recensement dans les communes de moins de 10 000 habitants ont lieu tous les cinq ans (en 2005, 2010, 2015, etc. pour Le Mesnil-Opac[23]) et les chiffres de population municipale légale des autres années sont des estimations[Note 2]. Le Mesnil-Opac a compté jusqu'à 433 habitants en 1841.\n• Église Notre-Dame ( siècle). Détruite en 1944, elle a été reconstruite selon les plans de l'architecte Pierre Sautier.

It is named after the river Yonne, which flows through it, in the country's north-central part. One of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté's eight constituent departments, it is located in its northwestern part, bordering Île-de-France. It was created in 1790 during the French Revolution. Its prefecture is Auxerre, with subprefectures in Avallon and Sens. Its INSEE and postcode number is 89.\n\nYonne is Bourgogne-Franche-Comté's fourth-most populous department, with a population of 335,707 (2019).[3] Its largest city is its prefecture Auxerre, with a population of about 35,000 within city limits and 68,000 in the urban area.\n\nThe first evidence of occupation in this area is found in the Grottes d'Arcy-sur-Cure, where paintings have been found dating back 28,000 years. The Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers of that time also left behind numerous flint artefacts. The area is believed to have been occupied for about 200,000 years.[4] By 4000 BC, a wave of Neolithics arrived from the Danube River region of eastern Europe. They built substantial wooden houses and introduced pottery decorated with the characteristics of the Linear Pottery culture. Further waves of migrants followed, the Chasséen culture, and the Michelsberg culture.[5]\n\nThe Celtic tribe in the area were named \"Icauna\", after the River Yonne which they thought sacred. The region was later occupied by Gallic tribes. In that period, the area came under the control of the Roman Empire, whose chief town was Sens, which they called Agendicum. It was the capital of their province of Gallia Lugdunensis, one of four provinces into which France was divided.[citation needed] The present main roads from Lyon to Boulogne, and from Sens to Alise-Sainte-Reine date from this period. About this time, Auxerre, Tonnerre (Tornodurum) and Avallon were growing in size. In the fourth century, Sens became a walled city. The first bishops were appointed in Sens and Langres, and they influenced the region profoundly because of their power.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1771, the north-westerly part of the present department belonged to Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony, the uncle of Louis XVI of France. The current Yonne department was organized and defined during the French Revolution, on March 4, 1790, as a result of the passing of an Act on December 22, 1789.[6] It was carved out of parts of the provinces of Burgundy, Champagne and Orléans, and to a lesser extent from parts of the Nivernais and Île-de-France.\n\nYonne is a department in central France, one of the eight constituent departments of the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. To the northeast lies the department of Aube, to the east lies Côte-d'Or, to the south lies Nièvre, to the west lies Loiret and to the northwest, the department of Seine-et-Marne. The River Yonne flows northwards through the department. Auxerre, the capital of the department, is situated on the River Yonne, and the River Serein joins this a few kilometres north of the city. The Canal de Bourgogne, which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic Ocean, joins the River Yonne through locks at Migennes a little further north. The second biggest town is Sens, situated at the confluence of the rivers Vanne and Yonne.[7]\n\nThe geology of the department is complex with concentric rings of granite, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks, and layers of sedimentary rocks. The terrain is mostly a low-lying plateau used for agriculture. The southwestern part is the Puisaye, which has a higher elevation and is more wooded. To the centre and east, the land inclines to the northwest where the higher land of the Tonnerrois region lies. To the east the rock is mostly limestone. The Auxerrois region is renowned for the grapes grown here, which are used in the production of Chablis wine. To the south lies the mountainous massif of Morvan, the highest parts of which are in the neighbouring department of Nièvre.[7] The department has some forested areas but is mainly used for pasture or cultivated for wheat.[8]\n\nThe most populous commune is Auxerre, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:[3]\n\nOver fifty percent of the inhabitants of the department are engaged in agricultural activities. Yonne is one of the poorest and most rural departments in France. During the hundred years leading up to 1962, its population declined by around 100,000, while all of the surrounding departments experienced population growth. Yonne had been bypassed by the development of the railways. As French industry flourished elsewhere in the late nineteenth century, the young people left Yonne seeking better opportunities, and the department stagnated.[citation needed]\n\nThe viticulture industry was severely affected by the advent of powdery mildew and the arrival of Phylloxera in the nineteenth century; at the same time, the development of the railway network allowed cheaper wines from other regions to undercut Chablis wine in the Paris market. The once-thriving industry never recovered.[11] By 1945, only 4000 hectares of grapevines remained, and only 471 hectares of grapes were grown for Chablis.[8]\n\nMore recently, the population trend has been reversed. During the period 1999 to 2007, it rose by 8000 to a total of 341,418. However, with a population of 46 inhabitants per square kilometre, the density in Yonne is still less than half that for the whole of France, which was 100.5 for the same year.[12]\n\nThe president of the Departmental Council is Patrick Gendraud, elected in 2017. In 2015, the General Council of the department was allotted a budget of 410 million euros.[13]\n\nThe department elects three members of parliament to the National Assembly. In the 2012–17 parliamentary term, two represented the right-wing Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and one the Socialist Party (France) (PS).\n• The medieval construction project of Guédelon Castle as of 2009Yonne (river) - Wikipedia: The Yonne (French: [jɔn] ⓘ) is a river in France, a left-bank tributary of the Seine. It is 292 km (181 mi) long.[1] The river gives its name to the Yonne département. It rises in the Nièvre département, in the Morvan hills near Château-Chinon. It flows into the river Seine at Montereau-Fault-Yonne.\n\nThe Yonne flows through the following départements and towns:\n\nThe main tributaries of the Yonne are the Vanne, the Armançon, the Serein and the Cure.\n\nThe river was historically used for flottage, or the floating of rafts of timber from the Morvan forest to serve the needs of the capital, Paris.[2] It was bypassed as a rafting waterway by the Canal du Nivernais in 1841, from near its source at Corbigny down to Auxerre.\n\nIn 1834 the engineer Charles Poirée had successfully tested his design for a needle weir, and this construction technique was adopted on the river Yonne. The first lock was built in the 1840s, the others from 1861. The locks were enlarged to Freycinet standards in the late 19th century, then again to their current dimensions after World War II.[3]\n\nThe navigable river Yonne extends for 108 km (67 mi), from Auxerre (junction with the Canal du Nivernais) to the confluence with the Seine.

Together they produced works that directly challenged the dictatorship that then ruled Brazil and experimented with photocopy machines and other new technologies. In 1982 the group disbanded, and França relocated to Chicago, where he pursued an MFA in art and technology at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and began working in video. França continued living in Chicago and making videos until he died from an AIDS-related illness in 1991.\n\nThe three videos displayed in this gallery showcase França’s experimentation with technique and form as well as his exploration of narrative and emotion. Fighting the Invisible Enemy is a largely abstract work that combines a discordant soundtrack with flickering images, sometimes of the artist himself. Without Fear of Vertigo uses interviews to allude to an ambiguous narrative of suicide and death. A Prelude to a Death Foretold not only celebrates love and intimacy but also memorializes the many friends França lost to AIDS-related illnesses. As its title suggests, A Prelude to a Death Foretold also foreshadowed the artist’s own passing not long after he completed this work.\n\nThe videos are shown in sequence, repeating every 20 minutes.\n\nPlease be aware that this presentation includes a discussion of suicide.Maroilles cheese - Wikipedia: Cow's-milk cheese made in the regions of Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais in France\n\nMaroilles (French pronunciation: [maʁwal] ⓘ), also known as Marolles, is a cow's-milk cheese made in the regions of Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais in northern France. It derives its name from the village of Maroilles in the region in which it is still manufactured.\n\nThe cheese is sold in individual rectangular blocks with a moist orange-red washed rind and a strong smell. In its mass-produced form it is around 13 centimetres (5 in) square and 6 centimetres (2 in) in height, weighing around 700 grams (25 oz) In addition, according to its AOC regulations, cheeses eligible for AOC status can be one of three other sizes:\n• Sorbais – (3/4) 12-12.5 cm square, 4 cm high, 550 g in weight. ripening: at least 4 weeks.\n• Mignon – (1/2) 11-11.5 cm square, 3 cm high, 350 g in weight. ripening: at least 3 weeks.\n• Quart – (1/4) 8-8.5 cm square, 3 cm high, 180 g in weight. ripening: at least 2 weeks.\n\nMaroilles is often reported to have first been made in 962 by a monk in the Abbey of Maroilles.[1] The cheese rapidly became famous throughout the region and was a favourite of several French kings including Philip II, Louis IX, Charles VI and Francis I.\n\nThe curd is shaped and salted before being removed from its mould and placed in a ventilated drying area for around ten days during which time a gentle light coating of bacteria develops. The cheese is then brushed and washed and cellared for at least five weeks, though periods of up to four months are not uncommon. During this time, it is turned and brushed at regular intervals to remove the natural white mould to allow its red bacteria to change the rind from yellow to red.\n\nThe finished cheese is a minimum of 45% fat, and is made in both pasteurised and unpasteurised forms. AOC status was granted in 1976 with AOP status following in 1996.[2] In 2005, 2,126 tons were made, of which around 6% came from the 10 fermier producers, with the remainder being made by the three industriel producers.[3]\n\nA number of less-common cheeses are made in northern France using very similar methods and are often listed in the \"Maroilles family\". These include Baguette Laonnaise (made in Laon), Boulette d'Avesnes (Avesnes-sur-Helpe), Boulette de Cambrai (Cambrai), Cœur d'Arras (Arras), Cœur d'Avesnes (Avesnes), Dauphin (Nord), Gris de Lille (Pas-de-Calais), Guerbigny (Picardy), and Rollot (Somme).\n\nThe very successful[4] 2008 French comedy film Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis jokes about the strong smell of Maroilles cheese.Maroilles (queso) - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Maroilles (también conocido como Marolles) es un queso de leche de vaca, elaborado en las regiones de Picardía y Norte-Paso de Calais en el norte de Francia, en los departamentos de Aisne y de Norte. Deriva su nombre de la localidad de Maroilles en la región en la que aún es manufacturado. Es un queso AOC desde 1976 y que ha obtenido DOP por Reglamento (CE) n.º 1107/96.[1]​\n\nSe considera que el primero en elaborar el Maroilles fue en 962 un monje en la Abadía de Maroilles,[2]​ cerca de Lille, en el norte de Francia. La abadía data del siglo VII. En 1174 el abad decretó que las villas de Maroilles y tres más elaboraran queso para él, fijando el 24 de junio como día de fabricación del queso y el 1º de octubre como el de la entrega. Los abades mejoraron el ganado para adecuarlo al clima y a los requerimientos de la producción quesera. El queso se hizo rápidamente famoso por toda la región y era el favorito de varios reyes franceses, entre ellos Felipe II, Luis IX, Carlos VI y Francisco I.\n\nSe hace tanto con leche pasteurizada como no pasteurizada. La cuajada es moldeada y salada antes de ser apartada de su molde y colocada en una zona ventilada para secar durante alrededor de 10 días, tiempo durante el cual se desarrolla una cubierta ligera de bacterias. El queso es entonces frotado y lavado y guardado en bodega durante al menos cinco semanas, pues el queso puede consumirse joven, cuando aún es calcáreo en el centro y con corteza amarga; no es infrecuente, sin embargo, que se tenga durante períodos de cuatro meses. Durante este tiempo, el queso se gira y frota regularmente con lo que la corteza cambia de color de amarillo a naranja y finalmente rojo. Este proceso es muy importante, puesto que el continuo girar del queso favorece el desarrollo de la bacteria que forma la corteza.\n\nEn 2005 se hicieron 2.126 toneladas de las que alrededor del 6% se hicieron por 10 productores fermier, siendo el resto obra de tres productores industriel.[3]​\n\nEl queso acabado tiene un mínimo del 45% de materia grasa. Se vende en bloques rectangulares individuales con una corteza lavada de color naranja-rojizo. En su forma producida masivamente tiene alrededor de 13 centímetros de lado y 6 centímetros de alto. Además, según las normas de la AOC, los quesos aptos para el estatus de AOC tienen que tener uno de estos tres tamaños:\n• Sorbais - (3/4) 12-12,5 cm lado, 4 cm alto, peso de 550 g. Maduración al menos 4 semanas.\n\nLa textura es semisuave. La pasta resulta blanda y aceitosa. Desprende un fuerte olor como de fruta fermentada. El sabor es frutal y ahumado.\n\nLos mejores períodos para hacerlo son mayo-junio y septiembre-octubre. Se recomienda tomarlo con un vino Châteauneuf-du-Pape.\n\nVarios quesos menos comunes se hacen en el norte de Francia usando métodos muy similares y a menudo se les menciona entre la \"familia de los maroilles\". Varían según la forma y el tamaño, pero todos ellos tienen en común la corteza lavada de color rojizo, sin moho. Son quesos pegajosos y ligeramente salados, parecidos: el Pont-l'Évêque y el Livarot (Queso)livarot. Pueden citarse:\n• Avesnes. Tiene un peso de 200 gramos. Está enriquecido con hierbas, clavo y pimienta. Se le da forma y se cubre con paprika.\n• Baguette Laonnaise. Hecho en la región de Picardía, departamento de Aisne, ciudad industrial de Laon. Tiene un 45 % de materia grasa. Se hace en forma de barra o de ladrillo, incluso redondo. Madura a lo largo de dos meses. Su textura es suave, con una pasta elástica y densa. Conforme va madurando, el queso desarrolla un sabor muy picante, especiado, y un final que recuerda a la granja. Se recomienda tomarlo con Coteaux Champenois y Bouzy.\n• Boulette d'Avesnes. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento de Paso de Calais, ciudad de Avesnes. Es un queso fresco con forma de cono. Se caracteriza por su textura especiada. Suave, sabor muy ácido. Inicialmente se hacía con el suero de leche que sobraba de la elaboración del queso o la mantequilla, amasando a mano la cuajada y mezclándola con perejil, pimienta o paprika. Se recomienda tomarlo con un Borgoña Passetoutgrains.\n• Boulette de Cambrai. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento Norte. Es un queso fresco.\n• Cœur d'Arras. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento de Paso de Calais, ciudad de Arras.\n• Cœur d'Avesnes. Hecho en la región de Picardía, departamento de Aisne, ciudad de Avesnes. Es un queso fundido.\n• Dauphin. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento del Norte. Se elabora con leche de cabra. Tiene un 45 % de materia grasa. Es como el Avesnes, pero en forma de delfín, como su nombre indica. Se hace con un Maroilles sazonado con perejil, estragón y pimienta. Madura durante 2-4 meses. La pasta es muy suave y ligeramente pegajosa. Este queso tiene un sabor especiado con olor a levadura. Se recomienda tomarlo con un vino Cotes du Rhone.\n• Gris de Lille. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento de Paso de Calais. Tiene un 45% de materia grasa. Se empapa en salmuera durante tres meses. Tiene un sabor salado y fuerte. También se lo conoce como Puant de Lille o Puant Macere. Cuanto más madura, más fuerte es y más al gusto del consumidor local. Su forma es cuadrada, con una corteza pegajosa de color gris rosado. La pasta es suave, ligeramente elástica. Se parece al Maroilles, pero el proceso de maduración es diferente. Marida bien con champán.\n• Guerbigny. Hecho en la región de Picardía, en la localidad del mismo nombre, Guerbigny. Tiene un 45% de materia grasa. Madura durante 5 semanas. Tiene forma de corazón. Su textura resulta suave. Desprende un olor fuerte. El sabor es pegajoso. Se recomienda tomarlo con un vino Sancerre Coteaux Champenois.\n• Rollot. Se hace en Picardía, siendo originario del pueblo de Rollot, en el Somme. Peso medio de 300 g. Forma de corazón.\n\nA nivel nacional, en Francia, el Maroilles es reconocido como appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) desde 1955, luego confirmada por los decretos de 1976 y del 29 de diciembre de 1986.​​[4]​ Desde 1996, es una denominación de origen protegida (PDO) ante la Unión Europea.[5]​​​​​​​​​​ ​A nivel internacional, cuenta con registro como denominación de origen, conforme al Sistema de Lisboa, ante la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual, desde el 20 de diciembre de 1967.[6]​\n• Le site de la Maison du Lait (en francés)\n• Le site de France Gourmet (en francés)\n• Maroiles en Tout Un Fromage (en francés)Everything you need to know about Maroilles cheese: Have you ever heard of a Northern French Cheese named Maroilles? It’s been really famous all over the world after the release of a blockbuster called “Welcome to the Sticks” (Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis) in France! This sweet cheese is definitely not as strong as you think it is and you might enjoy tasting it with your coffee during breakfast… Do you doubt it? We can make you a whole different person, you know? Let’s try it!\n\nFind out all about the Ch’ti cheese that arouses both curiosity and taste buds…\n\nWhat type of cheese is it?\n\nMaroilles is a soft, washed-rind cheese from the Northern region of France. It’s a cow’s milk cheese, with a creamy texture and a strong, pronounced taste. Its distinctive orange rind is the result of regular washing of the cheese during ripening, giving it a distinctive, aromatic flavor.\n\nWhere does Maroilles come from?\n\nMaroilles is produced in the Hauts-de-France region, formerly known as Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The origins of Maroilles go back to the Middle Ages, when the monks of Maroilles Abbey developed this cheese from the milk of local cows. Since then, the tradition of making Maroilles has been perpetuated in the region, making it a symbol of local gastronomy.\n\nWhich cheese is similar to Maroilles?\n\nA similar cheese to Maroilles is Munster, from the Alsace region of France. Like Maroilles, Munster is a soft, washed-rind cheese with a robust flavor and creamy texture. While each cheese has its own nuances of flavor, Maroilles lovers will often also appreciate Munster for its similar characteristics. There’s also Limburger, more popular in the US.\n\nUnfortunately, this cheese is not recommended to pregnant women. Maroilles has a washed-rind, which makes it more likely to develop bacteria.\n\nYou can buy Maroilles in our cheese shops when you visit Paris, in lots of cheese shops all around France (even in some supermarkets) and probably in some French cheese dairies in the US. Good luck!\n\nIs it really eaten with coffee in the north of France?\n\nYes, it’s true that in some areas of northern France, notably the (former) Nord-Pas-de-Calais, it’s common to enjoy Maroilles with coffee. This surprising combination of flavors, combining the intensity of the cheese with the richness and bitterness of the coffee, is appreciated by many locals. It’s a local tradition, a testament to culinary daring and a love of regional produce.\n\nOur 5 best recipes with Maroilles (made in Paroles de Fromagers)\n\nLet’s move on to our top 5 original recipes featuring Maroilles, including the famous Maroilles tart.\n• Melt the butter in a frying pan and sauté the sliced onion until golden and caramelized.\n• Place the shortcrust pastry in a tart tin and prick the base with a fork.\n• Arrange the slices of Maroilles on the base of the tart, then spread the caramelized onions on top.\n• In a bowl, beat the eggs with the crème fraîche, then season with salt and pepper.\n• Pour the egg and cream mixture over the onions and maroilles.\n• Bake the flamiche for 30-35 minutes, until the crust is golden and the filling is set.\n• Leave to cool for a few minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n• Season chicken fillets with salt and pepper on both sides.\n• In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add chicken fillets and cook on each side until golden and cooked through, about 5-6 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n• In the same pan, add a little more butter if necessary, then add the sliced mushrooms. Sauté until golden and tender, about 5 minutes. Add the minced onion and chopped garlic, then continue to cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender and fragrant.\n• Reduce the heat to medium-low, then add the diced Maroilles and crème fraîche to the pan.

At one point during the game, he grabbed Draymond Green's leg and was stomped on the chest by Green afterwards. As a result, Sabonis was assessed with a technical foul.[152] The Kings were eliminated in seven games.\n\nOn July 2, 2023, Sabonis and the Kings terminated the remaining one-season contract worth $19.4 million and signed a five-year contract extension worth $217 million.[153] This is the most profitable contract in Lithuania's sport history.[154]\n\nOn December 18, Sabonis logged the 35th triple-double of his career with 28 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in a 143–131 win over the Washington Wizards.[155] On January 3, 2024, Sabonis recorded a triple-double with 22 points, a then season-high 23 rebounds and 12 assists in a 138–135 double overtime win over the Orlando Magic.[156] On January 29, 2024, Sabonis scored 20 points on 10-of-11 shooting from the field, grabbed a career-high 26 rebounds and delivered 5 assists in a 103–94 win against the Memphis Grizzlies.

The other was Wilt Chamberlain, who did it six times.[157]\n\nOn February 13, Sabonis posted his 50th career triple-double with 35 points, 18 rebounds, 12 assists and 3 blocks in 130–125 loss against the Phoenix Suns.[158] On March 12, Sabonis recorded his 47th consecutive double-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists in a 129–94 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.

However, Davies' children gave their blessing for Sabonis to use the retired number.[162] On October 26, Sabonis posted his 59th career triple-double with 29 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists in 131–127 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.

He grabbed a tournament-high 27 rebounds against Poland on July 27. In 2013, at 17 years of age, Sabonis played for the Lithuania U-18 team in 2013 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. He averaged 14 points, 11.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game[169] and was tournament leader in rebounds per game.[170] While playing against Serbia, he scored 22 points, grabbed 22 rebounds and dished out 3 assists. Lithuania won the game 74–70 in OT.[171] In 2014, coach Jonas Kazlauskas included Sabonis on the preliminary list for the Lithuania men's national basketball team.[172] In 2014, D.Sabonis played in the FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship for the second time. This time he averaged 15.9 points, 12.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game.[173][174] On July 9, 2015, he was invited to join the Lithuania men's national team training camp for the first time.[175] On July 15, by participating in 2015 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship, Sabonis achieved the tournament rebounds record by grabbing 28 against Ukraine.[176] He led the tournament at 13.2 rebounds per game.[177]\n\nOn July 29, 2015, Sabonis debuted for the Lithuania men's national team in a game against Australia, scoring 4 points and grabbing 7 rebounds.[178] Sabonis was the youngest player ever to play for the national team, beating Jonas Valančiūnas by a matter of days.[179] Sabonis averaged 6 points and 5.9 rebounds during the preparation games phase, and was the team's second best rebounder after Valančiūnas.[180] Sabonis played for Lithuania at EuroBasket 2015, winning a silver medal in his debut year.[181] He also was a member of the Lithuanian Olympic national team during the 2016 Summer Olympics, where he averaged 5.5 points and 4.5 rebounds.[182]\n\nSabonis married Shashana Rosen on August 15, 2021, in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France; the wedding was officiated by a rabbi.[183] They welcomed their first child, a son named Tiger, on March 11, 2022, and were expecting a second child in summer 2023.[184] The family keeps Shabbat and eats only kosher food.[183] In April 2023, his wife announced that Sabonis was in the process of converting to Judaism.[183] Sabonis and his wife launched a wine brand in November 2024, dubbed Ones by Sabonis.[185]\n• List of European basketball players in the United StatesDomantas Sabonis - Ala pivot de Sacramento Kings: Celtics y Cavs ganaron con autoridad en el día de Martin Luther KingRCD Espanyol - Wikipedia: Reial Club Deportiu Espanyol de Barcelona (Catalan: [rəˈjal ˈklub dəpuɾˈtiw əspəˈɲɔl də βəɾsəˈlonə]; \"Royal Spanish Sports Club of Barcelona\"), commonly known as RCD Espanyol, is a Spanish professional sports club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.\n\nFounded in 1900 in Barcelona, Espanyol currently play their home games just outside the city at the RCDE Stadium, which holds up to 40,000 spectators. Domestically, Espanyol has won the Copa del Rey four times, most recently in 2006. In international competitions, the club reached the UEFA Cup final in 1988 and 2007. It has a long-standing rivalry with FC Barcelona.\n\nInitially known as the Sociedad Española de Football on its foundation, the name was changed to Club Español de Fútbol in 1901. In 1906, the club folded due to financial reasons and most of the players joined the X Sporting Club, which came to win the Campionat de Catalunya three times in a row before disappearing in 1908 to merge with the Spanish Jiu-Jitsu Club to be effectively relaunched as the Club Deportivo Español, and in 1910, they adopted their present-day colours. Espanyol is one of several Spanish football clubs granted patronage by the Spanish crown and thus entitled to use Real in their names and the royal crown on their badge. This right was granted to Espanyol in 1912 by Alfonso XIII and the club subsequently became known as the Real Club Deportivo Español.[2]\n\nFollowing the abdication of the same king in 1931 and the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic, due to prohibition of royal symbols, the club adopted the more Catalan/republican friendly name, Club Esportiu Espanyol. After the Spanish Civil War, the name was reverted.\n\nThe club took the Catalan spelling for its name in February 1995. The word \"Deportiu\" in Reial Club Deportiu Espanyol de Barcelona is a Catalanised form of the original word \"Deportivo\" (Castilian), despite the correct word being \"Esportiu\" in the Catalan language. This choice was made in order to retain the initials \"RCD\" in the club's name.\n\nEspanyol was founded on 25 October 1900 by Ángel Rodríguez Ruiz, an engineering student at the University of Mariquitas.[3] The club's original home was in the well-off district of Sarrià; Espanyol was the first club in Spain to be formed exclusively by Spanish fans of the game, with the other early clubs having links to Britain or central Europe.\n\nA friend of the club founder owned a textile business and happened to have an abundance of yellow material left over from a job. In 1910, the club changed its name to the Club Deportivo Español and at the proposal of Eduardo Corrons, the club's number one partner for many years, the club agreed to choose blue and white stripes as shirt colours and as the central colours of the club badge.[4] Blue and white were chosen in homage to the colours appearing on the shield of the great Sicilian-Aragonese Admiral Roger de Lluria, who sailed the Mediterranean protecting the interests of the Crown of Aragon in the Middle Ages.[4] The club was successful from the very beginning, winning the first Campionat de Catalunya in 1903 and subsequently playing in the first Copa del Rey in 1903.[5]\n\nIn 1906 Club Español de Football had to suspend its activities due to a lack of players, since most of them were university students who enrolled to study at universities outside Catalonia. X Sporting Club took advantage of this as most of the remaining Español players joined them, which meant a big leap in quality for the club, and as a result, the X won the Catalan championship three times in a row between 1905 and 1908, beating the likes of FC Internacional and FC Barcelona for the title.[6] This historic side had the likes of Pedro Gibert, José Irízar and Santiago Massana. It was not until 1909 that X and Español were restructured again, when several of the former university students returned to Barcelona with the idea of refounding Club Español de Football, which they achieved on 27 December 1908, when X merged with the Spanish Jiu-Jitsu Club.[6]\n\nIn the 1910s, they won the Campionat de Catalunya three times, in 1911–12, 1914–15 and 1917–18, winning later largely thanks to their backline led by Ricardo Zamora. They also reached the final of the Copa del Rey twice in 1911 and 1915, but lost to Athletic Bilbao on both occasions.[7]\n\nIn 1994, Espanyol created its reserve team, Espanyol B,[8] currently playing in the Segunda División B.\n\nJavier Clemente was hired in 1986. In his first season, he took the team to a joint-best 3rd place, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. They defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach, A.C. Milan, Inter Milan, TJ Vitkovice and Club Brugge KV to reach the final, losing on penalties to Bayer 04 Leverkusen after a 3–3 aggregate draw.[9] Two relegations followed, but the club remained in La Liga from winning the 1993–94 Segunda División until relegated at the conclusion of the 2019-20 COVID pandemic impacted season.\n\nJuli Pardo oversaw the transformation of the club into a Sociedad Anónima Deportiva.[10] In the wake of the accumulated debt, the club were forced to sell the Sarrià Stadium, which was eventually demolished in 1997.[10]\n\nPaco Flores' Espanyol won the 2000 Copa del Rey Final 2–1 against Atlético Madrid at Mestalla, a first cup win since 1940.[11] Six years later, under Miguel Ángel Lotina, the club won again, this time 4–1 against Real Zaragoza in Madrid, with goals by Raúl Tamudo, Luis García (two) and Coro.[12]\n\nWith this cup win, Espanyol entered the UEFA Cup. They won all their group games, before dispatching Livorno, Maccabi Haifa, Benfica, and Werder Bremen to reach the final. In the final, held on 16 May at Hampden Park in Glasgow, Espanyol fell to fellow La Liga side Sevilla, losing 3–1 in a shootout following a 2–2 draw.[13] They became the only football team in UEFA Cup history to remain unbeaten in the tournament, yet not take home the trophy. Walter Pandiani, who would leave the club at the end of the season, was the UEFA Cup's top goalscorer that season. On 9 June 2007, Tamudo became Espanyol's highest-ever goalscorer after surpassing the 111 goals scored by Rafael Marañón, and ended the night with 113.\n\nOn 31 May 2009, Espanyol played its last match at the Estadio Olímpico de Montjuic, a 3–0 defeat of Málaga. Espanyol had played in the Estadi Olímpic after moving from their previous ground in Sarria. With the move, club talisman Raúl Tamudo had the unique distinction of having played in three different home stadiums with his club: Sarrià, Montjuïc and, beginning in the 2009–10 season, the Cornellà-El Prat.\n\nIn January 2009, former Espanyol defender Mauricio Pochettino was hired as manager with the club in the relegation zone – his first senior job.[14] He won 2–1 against rivals Barcelona at the Camp Nou in February to help keep the club up; Barcelona, under Pep Guardiola, won the treble that season.[15]\n\nAfter 12 seasons playing at the Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc, Espanyol moved to the Estadi de Cornellá-El Prat. The new stadium was officially inaugurated on 2 August 2009 with a match between Espanyol and Liverpool; Espanyol won 3–0, with Luis García scoring the first goal at the ground, followed by a Ben Sahar double.[16] Six days later, Espanyol captain Daniel Jarque died from a cardiac arrest aged 26 in the Florence neighbourhood of Coverciano, where the club was at the time after playing several fixtures in Italy.[17] Since then, in the 21st minute – his former shirt number – of every Espanyol match, an ovation is made in his honour for a full minute.\n\nAfter Pochettino left in 2012, the club maintained themselves in the top flight under a series of other managers. In January 2016, Chinese businessman Chen Yansheng took over the club by acquiring a 54% stake.[18] In the 2018–19 season, Espanyol finished 7th, thus returning to the Europa League for the first time since their final run in 2006–07.[19] However, the club suffered relegation for the first time since 1994 the following season, after a 1–0 loss at Barcelona.[20][21] On 3 August 2020 the club published an official statement urging La Liga to suspend relegation; nevertheless relegation was not avoided.[22] Espanyol won promotion back to La Liga at the first attempt on 8 May 2021 following a 0–0 draw against Zaragoza, with four matches to spare in the 42-game season.\n\nSince 2022, Espanyol has achieved a strategic cooperation with LEYU SPORTS. And LEYU became Official Asian Partner of RCDE.[23] On 28 May 2023, Espanyol relegated to the Segunda División after two seasons in La Liga. Following a 4th Place finish in the Segunda División, the club was promoted back to La Liga following a promotion 2-0 (2-1 agg.) win against Real Oviedo on 23 June 2024.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century during the Miguel Primo de Rivera dictatorship (1923–1930), FC Barcelona was seen as a symbol of Catalan identity. This contrasted with RCD Espanyol which cultivated a kind of compliance with the central authority.[24]\n\nIn 1918, the municipalities of Catalonia promoted a campaign to ask the Spanish Government for a Statute of Autonomy. FC Barcelona joined that request and the Catalan press recognised FC Barcelona as a major cultural arm of the Catalan independence movement. The city's other team, RCD Espanyol, dissociated itself from the claim due to the former's success on the European stage.[25][26]\n\nToday FC Barcelona is the club that is closer to the political powers in Catalonia. Its last presidents have linked the club with the Catalan independence movement and the holding of a referendum, even though this causes discomfort among some Catalan fans and those in the rest of Spain who feel neglected and think the team is biased against them.[27] Although some of RCD Espanyol's directors have expressed pro-independence stances, the club stays out of politics. It is believed that most of the team's fans are against the independence of Catalonia.[28]\n\nOn numerous occasions RCD Espanyol has complained of unfavourable and sometimes directly offensive treatment towards the club in favour of FC Barcelona by some Catalonian public media like TV3.[29][30][31]\n\nDespite these differences in ideology, the derbi (derby) has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than those of Barcelona (who hold El Clásico in higher regard instead) due to the difference in objectives.\n\nThough it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the league table, Espanyol has only managed to finish above Barça on three occasions in almost 70 years and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 victory in 1951.\n\nEspanyol achieved a 2–1 win against FC Barcelona during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[32]\n\nEspanyol lost 0–1 to FC Barcelona on 8 July 2020, to be relegated to the Segunda División.[20][21]\n\nFrom 1923 until 1997, Espanyol played their home games in Estadi de Sarrià in the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district of Barcelona. In 1997, they moved to the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys on Montjuïc. For the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Espanyol moved into the newly constructed RCDE Stadium (also known as Estadi Cornellà-El Prat) between Cornellà de Llobregat and El Prat de Llobregat.\n• In 1928, Espanyol became a founding member of La Liga, and in 1929, the team won their first Copa del Rey. Espanyol has completed the highest number of seasons in La Liga without winning the title.\n• The team has qualified for the UEFA Cup/Europa League eight times (including the qualifications following their 2000 and 2006 Spanish Cup wins, which in earlier eras would instead have granted entry to the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup) and reached the final in 1988, 33 34 35 36 losing to Bayer Leverkusen of then-West Germany on penalty kicks (3–2), after a two-legged final of contrasts ended level (3–0 in Barcelona, 0–3 in Leverkusen) 37 38 and in 2007, losing to compatriots Sevilla, again on penalties (3–1) after a memorable match at Hampden Park, Glasgow ended 1–1 after normal time, and 2–2 after extra time.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

In March 2017, the Association of Supporters and Shareholders of RCD Espanyol boosted a project for recovering the sporting sections of the club, but this time without any economic link with the football team. The new multi-sports club was created with the name of Seccions Deportives Espanyol (Sporting sections Espanyol).[47]\n\nTwo months later, the association confirmed that Espanyol would start competing in the 2017–18 season, with a roller hockey team and women's volleyball teams.[48] In the next season, the basketball section was refounded and a new section of handball would be created.Girona FC And RCD Espanyol, LALIGA’s Other Catalan Clubs: FC Barcelona casts a big shadow. Barça’s style of play, trophy cabinet and star players, like Messi, Cryuff and now Gavi, often overshadow those of all other clubs in Spain besides Real Madrid. The Catalan giants have a global footprint few clubs can compete with, making life in their vicinity very difficult for anyone. Regional rivals Girona FC, and crosstown rivals RCD Espanyol understand they will seldom reach the sporting heights or popularity that Barça does and thus are finding other ways to bring their own identities and flavor to Spanish soccer’s top two divisions.\n\nFans paying attention to this year’s competition will note that RCD Espanyol is absent from the standings. Unfortunately for the club in Cornellà - a municipality neighboring Barcelona proper - relegation from LALIGA last season means Spain’s top division only has two Catalan clubs this season. Still, the second division club continues to bring fans through the doors as it fights to regain its place amongst Spain’s elite. At the other end of the spectrum, Girona FC goes into gameweek thirteen top of the LALIGA standings with 31 points and more goals scored than any other club in the competition. So, what more should fans know about the Catalan clubs that exist in Barcelona’s shadow, and what does the future hold for them?\n\nReal Club Deportivo Espanyol is a founding member of LALIGA. Created by students from the University of Barcelona back in 1900, Los Pericos (The Parakeets) are 123 years-old and have spent 87 seasons in Spain’s top division. Los Blanquiazules (The Blue and Whites) are four time winners of Spain’s Copa del Rey and were once home to LALIGA icons Ricardo Zamora, Alfredo Di Stefano, Raúl Tamudo and Mauricio Pochettino. Espanyol also holds an unbreakable record: it was the first club to score a LALIGA goal. Winger Pitus Prat netted the goal on February 10th 1929 against Real Unión de Irún.\n\nHaving wandered from the quiet, village-like neighborhood of Sàrria - to the top of Montjuïc - where Barcelona currently plays - in search of a permanent home, in 2009 Los Pericos finally settled in at Stage Front Stadium on the outskirts of the city. The state-of-the-art facility seats 40,000 spectators and is in contention to be one of the host venues for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. Espanyol was also one of the first European clubs to realize the benefits of environmental sustainability, equipping the stadium with over 2,700 solar panels on its roof, and a sustainable water recycling system to improve energy efficiency and reduce hydro waste.\n\nDirector of Communications, Sergio Aguilar, says that while the club always seeks to win on the field, it looks for ways to win off of it as well. Making a mark in the community and developing a strong relationship with fans is deeply important to a club that knows titles and superstars come few and far between. This is why Espanyol is consistently collaborating with local, national and international organizations to create positive social impact. As one club official puts it, “we want to be a purpose-driven company and create a sense of pride in being an Espanyol fan.”\n\nThis season the club has already won plaudits from around the world for its cute and innovative project, Els Perics No Abandonen (The Parakeets Don’t Abandon), which saw players walking out before the game with rescue puppies in their arms. The project is part of the club’s wider Superliga Solidaria (Superleague of Solidarity) charitable initiative which encourages inter-club collaboration and seeks to “allocate resources to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society.” In this instance, the club was highlighting animal abandonment, a growing problem in Spain, where in 2022 over 290,000 pets were abandoned or given to shelters.\n\nSuperliga Solidaria is born from the club’s joint response - alongside the Catalan association “Es Per Tu” - to the invasion of Ukraine. Seeing the suffering of the Ukrainian people, the joint partnership sent the official team bus to Poland full of food, first aid materials and medicine. The goods were distributed to those in need in Ukraine and the bus was used to transport war-affected Ukrainian children to safe haven in Spain. Seeing the impact of its efforts, Espanyol decided to continue using its social platform to promote and support social causes.\n\nPutting its money where its mouth is, Espanyol is committing 5% of the value of each season ticket sold towards Superliga Solidaria. Through the project, Los Blanquiazules have collaborated with over 200 organizations, including other LALIGA clubs such as Real Betis, Athletic Club and Girona FC. The club has helped organize food drives, it sent food and necessities to Türkiye and Syria after the devastating earthquake and it has helped distribute information to help local businesses get much-needed financial aid in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moving forward, Espanyol hopes to increase its efforts and visibility and will do so with the help of its volunteer network - created in 2015, which serves to strengthen the relationship between the club and its supporters and get fans involved in the club’s social work.\n\nOn the field, Espanyol is battling to return to the first division with a budget that has been slashed in half due to relegation. At the time of writing, the team is in 5th place in the standings, but the head coach was just let go. Despite the uncertainty on field, stadium attendance has increased this season as fans continue to buy into the club’s greater sense of purpose. Espanyol knows that life in the first division will allow it to attract a wider audience and share its brand with the world. It is seeking to become LALIGA’s third Catalan club in the top flight next season but will brave the ups and downs of professional soccer maintaining its local essence and focus on social causes.\n\nUnlike its big-city neighbors Espanyol and Barcelona, Girona does not have a storied history in LALIGA. Founded in 1930 out of necessity after the popular UE Girona dissolved due to insolvency, the club has been a perennial battler in the lower divisions of Spanish soccer. In fact, it was not until 2017 - after three failed attempts in a row - that the Gironistes reached LALIGA. Despite momentary glory, the club was relegated to the second division on the last day of the 2018-19 season and has had to fight its way back to the top.\n\nCEO Ignasi Mas-Bagà calls Girona a stubborn, persistent club that focuses on hard work, and the pursuit of excellence. Despite hailing from the capital city of the province (also named Girona), the club is a small fish in LALIGA’s rough waters. But Mas-Bagà insists this is a positive. Girona FC has capitalized on its lack of size to grow extremely close to its fanbase, providing it an authentic matchday experience. The CEO notes that watching a game at Estadi Montilivi - the smallest stadium in LALIGA, capacity 14,624 - is unlike going anywhere else in Spain. Fans can hear the ball being kicked, and can often even hear the players yelling to each other, or the orders being handed down by the coaches, such is the proximity to the field.\n\nFor all the glitz and glamor of elite level soccer, a day at Montilivi can remind fans of the simplicity of the game - twenty-two players running around with a ball at their feet, being spurred on by a fervent home crowd. And the players understand the club ethos, often staying on the field after the game to sign autographs and take pictures with their adoring fans.\n\nThe club is currently enjoying its moment in the sun. Girona is in first place after twelve games and producing some of the most exciting soccer in the division despite having the thirteenth highest salary budget in the league. But people around the club are remaining calm. The objective at the outset of the season was to remain in the league and thereby help consolidate the club’s economic and sporting future. So far, the club looks set to do that and more, but Ignasi makes it clear that while there is an aspiration to compete in Europe and win titles, the club has a long-term plan and is not obsessed with winning at all costs right now.\n\nPart of the reason Girona FC - a club from a charming, albeit small, city, better known for Michelin stars than soccer stars - can take a long-term approach in the cutthroat world of sports is thanks to City Football Group (CFG). On August 23rd, 2017, CFG invested in Girona FC, and has since become the club’s majority shareholder. CFG is funded by the royal family of the United Arab Emirates and has an extensive portfolio of sports investments, most notably reigning Premier League and UEFA Champions League champions Manchester City. Ignasi admits that CFG has brought stability, necessary investment and the know-how to help implement a long-term vision, but insists that the day-to-day management of the club is done by his team on the ground. And while it is tempting to think that Girona’s success is down to huge sums of money, the club’s net spend on players is only $3.2 million since CFG acquired its portion of the club in 2017.\n\nHowever, the stability CFG has brought has been pivotal for Girona’s growth as a club. Mas-Bagà, who took the reins as CEO in 2015, says he inherited a club that had no club shop, sold only 800 jerseys a season and had one of the oldest fanbases in the country. Instead of competing with the likes of Barcelona, Ignasi understood that fans could enjoy supporting both Catalan clubs. Through targeted social media campaigns, great matchday experiences and an exciting style of play, the club has been able to capture the attention of the next generation of fans. Now the club sells nearly 11,000 shirts a season, generating over 1 million euros on jersey sales alone. But what makes Girona’s CEO most happy is seeing young kids heading to school in their Girona jerseys: proof of the club’s appeal.\n\nGirona’s transformation is also thanks to its daring attitude. Coach Michel has the team playing swashbuckling soccer that creates good goal-scoring opportunities which the players are currently finishing. In the boardroom, Ignasi says his staff is equally daring. Filled with young, hungry professionals who have local ties, the team looks to challenge an industry that Mas-Bagà admits can be quite old school at times. The club has seized opportunities to sign sponsorship deals with local businesses and leverages the CFG network, providing package deals to companies who may want ties in Catalonia and other places within the company portfolio, like Manchester, New York, Abu Dhabi or Mumbai.\n\nLike Espanyol, Girona has also recognized the value of social impact through soccer. Locally, club players and staff members enter into schools in tougher neighborhoods to help educate children through soccer. The Red and Whites also use their platform to support the local NGO Open Arms, which helps rescue refugees abandoned in international waters off the coast of Spain.\n\nRegardless of the success on the field, the club continues to emphasize sustained economic and sporting growth. It is looking to expand its influence on social media and is finalizing a new 57-acre training complex just outside the city. The club expects its first team will be training there by the end of this season and hopes to move all academy and staff members to the Vilablareix complex by the end of 2025, or early 2026. After that the club will begin renovating Estadi Montilivi, which it hopes to increase to 20,000 capacity.\n\nLife in the shadow of one of the greatest clubs on Earth must be tough, but Espanyol and Girona both show the personality to step out of that shadow each weekend. Whether it is for sporting or social reasons, fans who neglect to watch these two pillars of the Spanish soccer community are missing out.Reddit - Dive into anything: By continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy.Top 10 jugadores de la NBA en la actualidad: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLB, UFC, Boxeo y miles de eventos en vivo, series originales exclusivas y mucho más. Suscríbete aquí\n\nFinalizada la temporada de NBA, hoy voy a contarles cuál es para mí el top 10 de jugadores en la actualidad. Como parámetro, no voy a usar estadísticas ni números que justifiquen. Voy a centrarme en el impacto que tienen y que tendrán en sus equipos para ganar.\n\nEl más picante de los escoltas de la nueva generación. Devin Booker va camino a ser el líder de los Phoenix Suns por su contracción al trabajo y su talento, pero por sobre todas las cosas por su coraje en momentos importantes. Cierra el top 10 y es justicia.\n\nEl Rey dio un paso atrás para que el resto se luzca y eso fue un acierto clave para que Los Angeles Lakers lleguen donde llegaron. LeBron James está noveno en la lista porque ya tiene 38 años y su carrera entró en el epílogo. Reúne máximo respeto: para quien escribe, es el segundo mejor de la historia detrás de Michael Jordan.\n\nKevin Durant solo está octavo porque tiene 34 años y su salud siempre pende de un hilo. Más allá del paso del tiempo, no existe un 'killer' como KD en la NBA. Un jugador que rompió el molde, uno de los mejores talentos ofensivos de la historia. ¿El problema? El tiempo pasa para todos.\n\nLuka Doncic supo estar más arriba en las consideraciones, pero la pasada temporada jugó por debajo de las expectativas. El cierre de los Dallas Mavericks en temporada regular tampoco ayudó y repercutió en lo que pensamos de él. Tiene solo 24 años. Es un genio del básquetbol, pero debe jugar más y quejarse menos.\n\n¿Tan abajo el MVP de serie regular? Yo creo que sí. La razón es que la primera parte de la temporada es algo muy distinto a los playoffs. El centro camerunés Joel Embiid es un gran jugador, pero tengo serias dudas que pueda llevar a un equipo al campeonato. Equivocado o no, solo el tiempo nos traerá esa respuesta.\n\nSi Marcus Smart es el corazón de los Boston Celtics, Jayson Tatum es el pincel. El arte hecho jugador, la calidad como método de triunfo. Revirtieron un fatídico 0-3 ante el Miami Heat y su lesión en el tobillo le impidió a Boston tener la chance de pelear el séptimo y hacer historia. Boston sin Tatum es un equipo del montón. Tan simple como eso.\n\nEl corazón del Heat y por gran parte de la postemporada que pasó, el máximo atractivo para todos. El espíritu de Jimmy Buckets es incomparable. La mente de acero que aún queda en la NBA. Miami fue un gran equipo, pero fue la determinación de Jimmy Butler la que llevó a un equipo de play-in a jugar las Finales de la NBA.\n\nEl mejor tirador de la historia sigue teniendo, a los 35 años, un impacto crucial en los Golden State Warriors. Es cierto, pudieron hacer un poco más ante los Lakers, pero Golden State llegó hasta ahí por el nivel de Steph Curry. Siempre movedizo, certero como nadie, es Top 10 de la historia. Sin dudas.\n\nPuede ser el mejor, pero el fracaso ante el Heat en primera ronda de playoffs (sí, fue un fracaso más allá de su lesión) lo empuja al segundo lugar. Físicamente, Giannis Antetokounmpo es superior a todo lo conocido. Y más allá del flagelo del tiro a distancia, domina el juego tanto en ataque como en defensa. Tendrá pronto una nueva chance.\n\nDespués de lo que vimos en las Finales de la NBA, no creo que haya nadie que pueda competirle al Gran Hermano del básquetbol, Nikola Jokic. El panóptico que ve todo desde la cima de la montaña. Máximo responsable del primer título de los Denver Nuggets en su historia. Hace felices a todos.\n\nMe hubiese gustado darle un lugar a Ja Morant en esta lista, pero resulta imposible poner como bueno a alguien que tiene que empezar a respetarse a sí mismo, a sus compañeros y a la Liga. La sanción de 25 partidos que le dio la NBA es liviana. Es ahora o nunca: no habrá cuarta oportunidad para él.\n\nHe aquí la lista de jugadores que podrían haber estado en el Top 10, pero que, en mi opinión, quedaron centímetros más abajo:Kobe Bryant: el legendario jugador de baloncesto de la NBA y una de sus hijas mueren en un accidente de helicóptero en California: Kobe Bryant: el legendario jugador de baloncesto de la NBA y una de sus hijas mueren en un accidente de helicóptero en CaliforniaFue elegido como el mejor jugador de básquet callejero de la historia y se dio el lujo de decirle que no a la NBA: “Ganaba más dinero vendiendo drogas”: Si en Argentina el fútbol nació en los potreros, en Estados Unidos el básquet nació en los playgrounds. Piso de cemento, dos aros generalmente con redes con cadenas, líneas pintadas y una pelota. Todo al aire libre a la vista de todos. En esas canchitas de barrio tan típicas de aquel país, ecosistema de tantos jóvenes, este deporte se desarrolló en su esencia más pura y llegó a niveles míticos por el talento innato que brota de sus urbes. Justamente allí, en las calles, el juego creció a la par de su popularidad, en especial entre los afroamericanos, protagonistas de picados que convocaban a miles de personas y quedaron en la memoria colectiva de aquellos ciudadanos de a pie que se convocaban, sin pagar un peso, lo más cerca posible de los límites del campo juego para ver a esos talentosos que despertaban admiración.\n\nAntes de que el básquet llegara a los estadios y se organizaran competencias millonarias, el show estuvo en la calle. Allí nacieron estrellas que aun hoy son mitos vivientes, algunas de las cuales ni siquiera jugaron en las ligas profesionales -casi como siguiendo un guión de Hollywood- pero tuvieron épicos duelos con las estrellas en esos playgrounds y todavía hoy viven en el imaginario colectivo de mucha gente. Con ellos crecieron famosas historias de actuaciones y partidos que hoy se recuerdan como anécdotas únicas que se trasladan de generación en generación. Y tal vez, en ese mundo tan especial, no haya figura más recordada -y venerada- que Joe Hammond, un flaquito sin pinta de crack que es considerado el mejor jugador callejero de básquet que nunca jugó profesionalmente. Autor de las hazañas más grandes en Rucker Park, el potrero más famoso del mundo, ubicado en la intersección de la calle 155 y la avenida 8 en el barrio de Harlem, Nueva York. La casa de las leyendas más grandes, cada una con apodos llamativos que han trascendido en el tiempo, como Earl “The Pearl” Manigault, Wilt “The Stilt” Chamberlain, Julius “Dr. J” Erving, Connie “The Hawk” Hawkins, Herman “Helicopter” Knowlings, “Pee Wee” Kirkland y “Fly” Williams.\n\nHablamos de alguien tan talentoso que fue capaz de llegar al segundo tiempo del partido callejero más importante de siempre y anotar 50 puntos en la cara del mismísimo Doctor J. Alguien que fue elegido en el Draft nada menos que por los Lakers, pero se dio el lujo de rechazar la oferta de la NBA porque “ganaba más dinero en la calle”, jugando y vendiendo drogas… En esta nota, la historia de The Destroyer -El Destructor-, un mito viviente, el mismo al que New York Times eligió en 1990 como el mejor jugador callejero de la historia…\n\nNo hubo un anotador como Hammond. Era flaquito, no parecía fuerte y media poco más de 1m90, pero sus piernas le permitían volar hacia el aro y tenía una característica: le gustaba tirar con tablero. Una vez, todos recuerdan, logró el récord de puntos en Rucker, con 73. Y poco después, en otra actuación cautivante, se dispuso a romperlo y lo hizo, llegando a 74. Kevin Durant, para muchos el mejor jugador ofensivo de la historia, fue una vez a esa canchita y le salieron todas. Así y todo llegó a 66, quedando a ocho de la marca de Joe. Hay demasiadas historias de cómo Hammond mandó a la escuela a varias figuras nacionales. Richie Adams, estrella de la Universidad de Las Vegas, confesó que, cuando tenía 19 años y estaba en su plenitud de juego, fue a Rucker y recibió una paliza de Hammond, que tenía 14 años más. “Ni me conocía y me pregunto si jugaba al básquet. Cuando le dije que sí, me invito a traer mi equipo. Fui con Gary Springer (figura de Iona) y no olvidaré jamás aquella lección”, reconoció.\n\nPero la historia más famosa fue aquella que sucedió en julio de 1971. Rucker se vistió de fiesta para el duelo más esperado de la historia. Cuentan los que estuvieron que había gente hasta donde daba la vista: subidos a los árboles y postes de luz, colgados de las cercas, subidos a los techos y observando con binoculares desde las ventanas de edificios cercanos. Pee Wee Kirkland, otro talento que era el compañero de Hammond en las hazañas en Rucker con el equipo llamado los Milbank Pros, había desafiado a una estrella NBA, Charlie Scott. “Si sos tan bueno, trae a tu equipo y vení a jugar a Rucker”, le dijo. Scott llevó a sus Westsiders, como llamaban a su banda, que tenía, entre otros, a Julius Erving, la famosa figura de la NCAA que tenía destino de superestrella -meses después promediaría 27.3 puntos y 15.7 rebotes en su primera temporada en la ABA, la liga que competía con la NBA- y, con el tiempo, también se convertiría en un mito de Rucker.\n\nLa expectativa fue creciendo con el correr de los días hasta transformarse en el único tema de charla en Harlem y sus alrededores. “Todos me preguntaban cómo me iría contra Julius y yo les decía que deberían preguntarme como le va a ir a él contra mí. Joe, incluso, ni siquiera quería jugar. Me lo dijo…”, contó Bob McCullough, otra figura callejera que luego sería el comisionado de Rucker.\n\nAllí comienza una leyenda que, para algunos, fue creciendo con el correr de los años. Las dudas sobre si Hammond asistiría se confirmaron cuando el partido comenzó sin él mientras las 6000 personas se preguntaban qué le habría sucedido... Los Westsiders, con Kirkland y Erving manejando las acciones, sacaron ventaja de 12 para el entretiempo... “De repente, cuando estábamos por comenzar el segundo tiempo, escuchamos un ‘haaaaaaa”, la marea de gente se abrió como el Mar Rojo y vimos ingresar a Joe desde la entrada del costado”, recordó McCullough. Hammond, quien dicen bajó de una limusina blanca, insistió que no fue una acción calculada -aunque pareció-, que solo se había equivocado de hora porque, básicamente, estaba muy ocupado jugando a los dados. Lo cierto es que su tardía llegada le dio un toque hollywodense al duelo que paralizaba Harlem.\n\n“Cuando miré el tablero, dije ‘a la mierda’. Pero puse manos a la obra”. Peter Vecsey, mítico periodista que en ese momento escribía en el diario Daily News, estuvo en el lugar como reportero y su artículo, con fotos, es la principal referencia de aquel duelo. “La diferencia se evaporó más rápido que las anfetaminas”, escribió sobre el show de Hammond, quien asegura anotó 50 puntos en el segundo tiempo para forzar dos alargues y terminar siendo el mejor de una tarde que, igualmente, no terminó como el barrio quería... En el tiempo extra, Scott fue el mejor, llevando a los Westsiders al triunfo por 117-108, con Erving terminando con 39.\n\n“Fue tanta la rivalidad y lo que generó el partido que, cuando terminó, estábamos en un costado de la cancha y un amigo de Joe me dijo ‘buen partido, pero nunca más pases la calle 116 porque vas a morir’”, contó Scott, pese a que era nativo de Harlem. Pero, claro, él había elegido otro camino -la NCAA con North Carolina y luego la NBA, desde donde llego al Hall of Fame-, totalmente distinto al de las estrellas callejeras. “Por supuesto que nunca más volví a la zona luego de ese comentario. Mucha gente se tomó muy en serio ese partido”, completó.\n\nAunque salió derrotado, lo de Hammond fue una verdadera exhibición, demostrando que tenía potencial para jugar entre los mejores y ser incluso superior a ellos. También puso a Rucker Park en el mapa, entre los mejores lugares para jugar y ver el mejor básquet. Y no cualquier básquet, el callejero, que de repente había dejado de ser ya solo un pasatiempo o una vía de escape para muchos, sino que podía ser un lugar del que saliesen profesionales y de altísimo nivel.\n\nA partir de ese duelo, ya nada fue igual para Hammond. Su fama se disparó, Rucker se transformó en un lugar de culto y, pocos meses después, nada menos que los Lakers usaban una elección de draft para seleccionarlo. Pero, claro, eran tiempos oscuros para él. Desde chico, inducido por su tío, había entrado en el mundo de las drogas, ya no solo del consumo, sino también del tráfico. Algunos de sus amigos, para alejarlo de ese ambiente, lo empujaron a tomar la opción de jugar durante un tiempo en los Allentown Jets de la Eastern Basketball Association (EBA), una de las ligas que pululaban en ese momento buscando un lugar preferencial entre la gente. Pero Joe no sentía el básquet organizado y todo lo que él acarreaba. No había jugado en el secundario, tampoco en la universidad y no quería ir a la NBA. Al punto, cuentan, que no iba a jugar partidos a los que se sabía que asistirían scouts de la liga profesional. Nada parecía seducirlo ni interesarle. Le gusta estar en la calle y jugar en la calle…\n\nPor eso tampoco se conmovió cuando supo de la elección de los Lakers, el equipo sensación que había logrado formar un tridente de estrellas como el conformaban Jerry West, Elgin Baylor y Wilt Chamberlain. Los angelinos habían ganado 48 de los 82 juegos y sólo los había frenado Milwaukee Bucks, con Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, en la final del Oeste. Hammond era la pieza que faltaba para terminar de formar una ofensiva tan creativa como devastadora. La franquicia, entonces, decidió elegirlo con el #5 del Hardship Draft, una selección alternativa que se armó con aquellos jugadores que no habían completado sus estudios universitarios. Le ofrecieron, entonces, 50.000 dólares, una casa, un auto y tres años de contrato. Mucho más que al resto de los jugadores. Para Hammond era la chance de asegurar el futuro, de confirmar todo lo que había mostrado en la cancha, de jugar con estrellas y hasta de salir campeón, como pasaría con ese equipo en 1972, tras vencer a los Knicks en la final... Pero Joe ignoró todo eso, lo dejó pasar.\n\nLa explicación la dio él mismo. “Aquellos tipos debían pensar que le estaban ofreciendo el mundo a un miserable negro del ghetto, pero yo no necesitaba para nada su dinero. Vendía drogas y jugaba a los dados en la calle desde que tenía 10 años. Con 15 tenía una cuenta secreta de mi padre en el banco de 50.000 dólares y cuando los Lakers me hicieron la oferta yo ya tenía 200.000 en mi apartamento. Ganaba miles de dólares vendiendo heroína, cocaína, crack y marihuana. ¿Para qué necesitaba los 50.000 de los Lakers? Lo único que hice fue decirles que yo merecía lo mismo que sus jugadores porque en realidad era mucho mejor que la mayoría de ellos, pero rechazaron pagarme más. Ellos no podían entender cómo un pordiosero podría estar regateándoles así y por supuesto tampoco yo les dije por qué”, comentó sin pelos en la lengua.\n\nAsí se cerró definitivamente la puerta de la NBA, porque cuando los otros equipos conocieron la respuesta de Hammond, también lo descartaron rápidamente. Los Nets de Erving lo intentarían, nuevamente, en el 73, pensando que tal vez jugar con un rival que Hammond había respetado en las calles podía ser una opción. “Joe fue Magic antes que Magic”, afirmó Lou Carnesseca, dueño de los Nets por aquel entonces. Ni con ese elogio logró convencerlo. Joe volvió a desechar una oferta de tres años para seguir dedicándose a jugar en la calle, vender drogas -a esa altura había heredado el negocio del tío- y quemar el dinero en mujeres, fiestas y más drogas.\n\nDe a poco, fue perdiendo su lugar en el mundo del tráfico y del básquet. Y quedando cada vez más solo, en especial cuando el dinero dejó de llegar y no paró de irse, cuando la fama de las canchas ya no alcanzó para darle de comer. Ni para detener a la Policía. Hammond pasó 11 años en distintas prisiones de Estados Unidos y, para cuando salió, ya estaba acabado. En todo sentido. Le quedó la calle, su lugar. Allí pedía limosnas y vivía de lo que le daban aquellos que todavía recordaban lo grande que había sido como jugador.\n\nDicen que se “limpió”, que a los 73 años anda mejor que nunca, que está recuperado… Todavía hoy se lo puede ver por las calles de Harlem. Todavía lo paran, lo felicitan, le agradecen, les cuentan sus hazañas, sobre todo aquella de los 50 puntos en un segundo tiempo, tarde que él describe “como el show más grande de la Tierra, una historia que es más grande que el mismo básquet”. Asegura no arrepentirse de nada. “Imagino que yo estoy hecho de otra madera de la que están hechas las leyendas, pero lo seguro es que no soy el bastardo que le quisieron hacer creer a la gente que soy”. Una leyenda que vivió y jugó a su manera, como quiso y donde quiso. Y que todavía hoy es recordado como un mito."}

You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.Alfred Le Fermier: You may also likeAlford plea - Wikipedia: Type of guilty plea in the United States\n\nIn United States law, an Alford plea, also called a Kennedy plea in West Virginia,[1] an Alford guilty plea,[2][3][4] and the Alford doctrine,[5][6][7] is a guilty plea in criminal court,[8][9][10] whereby a defendant in a criminal case does not admit to the criminal act and asserts innocence, but accepts imposition of a sentence.[11][12][13] This plea is allowed even if the evidence to be presented by the prosecution would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.[5][14][15][16][17] This can be caused by circumstantial evidence and testimony favoring the prosecution, and difficulty finding evidence and witnesses that would aid the defense.\n\nAlford pleas are legally permissible in nearly all U.S. federal and state courts, except in the state courts of Indiana, Michigan, and New Jersey, or in the United States military courts.\n\nThe Alford guilty plea is named after the United States Supreme Court case of North Carolina v. Alford (1970).[10][12] Henry Alford had been indicted on a charge of first-degree murder in 1963. Evidence in the case included testimony from witnesses that Alford himself had said, after the victim's death, that he had killed the individual. Court testimony showed that Alford and the victim had argued at the victim's house. Alford left the house, and afterward, the victim received a fatal gunshot wound when he opened the door responding to a knock.[18]\n\nAlford was faced with the possibility of capital punishment if convicted in a jury trial.[19] The death penalty was the default sentence in North Carolina at the time if two criteria were satisfied: the defendant had to have pleaded not guilty, and the jury did not instead recommend a life sentence. Had Alford pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, he would have had the possibility of a life sentence and would have avoided the death penalty, but he did not want to admit guilt. Nonetheless, Alford pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and said he was doing so to avoid a death sentence, were he to be convicted of first-degree murder after attempting to contest that charge.[18][20] Alford was sentenced to 30 years in prison after the trial judge accepted the plea bargain and ruled that the defendant had been adequately advised by his lawyer.[18]\n\nAlford appealed and requested a new trial, arguing he was forced into a guilty plea because he was afraid of receiving a death sentence. The Supreme Court of North Carolina ruled that the defendant had voluntarily entered the guilty plea with knowledge of what that meant. Following this ruling, Alford petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, which upheld the initial ruling, and subsequently to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled that Alford's plea was not voluntary because it was made under fear of the death penalty.[18] \"I just pleaded guilty because they said if I didn't, they would gas me for it,\" wrote Alford in one of his appeals.[21]\n\nThe case was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where Justice Byron White wrote the majority decision.[22] The Court held that for the plea to be accepted, the defendant must have been advised by a competent lawyer who could inform him that his best option was to enter a guilty plea.[19] The Court ruled that the defendant can enter such a plea \"when he concludes that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly indicates guilt.\"[21] The Court allowed the guilty plea with a simultaneous protestation of innocence only because there was enough evidence to show that the prosecution had a strong case for conviction and that the defendant was entering such a plea to avoid the possible sentence. The Court noted that even if the defendant could have shown that he would not have entered a guilty plea \"but for\" the rationale of receiving a lesser sentence, the plea itself would not have been ruled invalid.[19] As evidence existed that could have supported Alford's conviction, the Supreme Court held that his guilty plea was allowable, while the defendant himself still maintained that he was not guilty.[20]\n\nThe Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and Foreign Political and Legal Terms defines the term \"Alford plea\" as: \"A plea under which a defendant may choose to plead guilty, not because of an admission to the crime, but because the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to place a charge and to obtain conviction in court. The plea is commonly used in local and state courts in the United States.\"[16] According to University of Richmond Law Review, \"When offering an Alford plea, a defendant asserts his innocence but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict him of the offense.\"[17] A Guide to Military Criminal Law notes that under the Alford plea, \"the defendant concedes that the prosecution has enough evidence to convict, but the defendant still refuses to admit guilt.\"[15] The book Plea Bargaining's Triumph: A History of Plea Bargaining in America published by Stanford University Press defines the plea as one in \"which the defendant adheres to his/her claim of innocence even while allowing that the government has enough evidence to prove his/her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\".[14] According to the book Gender, Crime, and Punishment published by Yale University Press, \"Under the Alford doctrine, a defendant does not admit guilt but admits that the state has sufficient evidence to find him or her guilty, should the case go to trial.\"[5] Webster's New World Law Dictionary defines Alford plea as: \"A guilty plea entered as part of a plea bargain by a criminal defendant who denies committing the crime or who does not actually admit his guilt. In federal courts, such plea may be accepted as long as there is evidence that the defendant is actually guilty.\"[10]\n\nThe Alford guilty plea is \"a plea of guilty containing a protestation of innocence\".[8] The defendant pleads guilty, but does not have to specifically admit to the guilt itself.[24] The defendant maintains a claim of innocence, but agrees to the entry of a conviction in the charged crime.[25] Upon receiving an Alford guilty plea from a defendant, the court may immediately pronounce the defendant guilty and impose sentence as if the defendant had otherwise been convicted of the crime.[13] Sources disagree, as may differing states' laws, as to what category of plea the Alford plea falls under: Some sources state that the Alford guilty plea is a form of nolo contendere, where the defendant in the case states \"no contest\" to the factual matter of the case as given in the charges outlined by the prosecution.[12] Others hold that an Alford plea is simply one form of a guilty plea,[9][10] and, as with other guilty pleas, the judge must see there is some factual basis for the plea.[13]\n\nDefendants can take advantage of the ability to use the Alford guilty plea by admitting there is enough evidence to convict them of a more serious crime, while at the same time pleading guilty to a lesser charge.[26] Defendants usually enter an Alford guilty plea if they want to avoid a possibly worse sentence were they to lose the case against them at trial.[13] It affords defendants the ability to accept a plea bargain while maintaining innocence.[27]\n\nThis form of guilty plea has been frequently used in local and state courts in the United States,[16] though it constitutes a small percentage of all plea bargains in the US.[14] This form of plea is not allowed in courts of the United States military.[15][18] In 2000, the United States Department of Justice noted: \"In an Alford plea the defendant agrees to plead guilty because he or she realizes that there is little chance to win acquittal because of the strong evidence of guilt. About 17% of State inmates and 5% of Federal inmates submitted either an Alford plea or a no contest plea, regardless of the type of attorney. This difference reflects the relative readiness of State courts, compared to Federal courts, to accept an alternative plea.\"[28]\n\nIn the 1995 case State of Idaho v. Howry before the Idaho Court of Appeals, the Court commented on the impact of the Alford guilty plea on later sentencing.[29] The Court ruled: \"Although an Alford plea allows a defendant to plead guilty amid assertions of innocence, it does not require a court to accept those assertions. The sentencing court may, of necessity, consider a broad range of information, including the evidence of the crime, the defendant's criminal history and the demeanor of the defendant, including the presence or absence of remorse.\"[29] In the 1999 South Carolina Supreme Court case State v. Gaines, that court held that Alford guilty pleas would be considered valid even in the absence of a specific on-the-record ruling that the pleas were voluntary, provided that the sentencing judge acted appropriately in accordance with the rules for acceptance of a plea made voluntarily by the defendant.[30] The Court held that a ruling that the plea was entered into voluntarily is implied by the act of sentencing.[30]\n\nIn a 2006 case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Ballard v. Burton, Judge Carl E. Stewart writing for the court held that an Alford guilty plea is a \"variation of an ordinary guilty plea\".[32] In October 2008, the United States Department of Justice defined an Alford plea as follows: \"the defendant maintains his or her innocence with respect to the charge to which he or she offers to plead guilty\".[31]\n\nIn March 2009, the Minnesota House of Representatives characterized the Alford plea as \"a form of a guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges on the record that the prosecutor could present enough evidence to prove guilt.\"[33] The Minnesota Judicial Branch similarly states: \"Alford Plea: A plea of guilty that may be accepted by a court even where the defendant does not admit guilt. In an Alford plea, defendant has to admit that he has reviewed the state's evidence, a reasonable jury could find him guilty, and he wants to take advantage of a plea offer that has been made. Court has discretion as to whether to accept this type of plea.\"[34]\n\nThe U.S. Attorneys' Manual states that in the federal system, Alford pleas \"should be avoided except in the most unusual circumstances, even if no plea agreement is involved and the plea would cover all pending charges.\" U.S. Attorneys are required to obtain the approval of an Assistant Attorney General with supervisory responsibility over the subject matter before accepting such a plea.[35][36]\n\nThe Alford plea has received public attention for its use in resolving high-profile post-conviction proceedings for individuals who claim they were wrongfully convicted for crimes they did not commit.[37] In 2011, the West Memphis Three—three men who had been convicted as teenagers of the 1993 murders of three children and sentenced to life in prison or, for one defendant, the death penalty—entered Alford pleas decades following their initial convictions.[37][38] New evidence had come to light that might exonerate them, so the Arkansas Supreme Court ordered an evidentiary hearing to consider whether a new trial would be required.[39] Instead of holding the hearing, the defendants and state prosecutors agreed that the court would vacate the prior convictions to permit the defendants to enter Alford pleas, be re-sentenced to \"time served,\" and obtain immediate release from prison.[37][38][39] As part of the plea deal, the men agreed not to sue the state seeking civil damages for their convictions and imprisonment.[38][39]\n\nSimilarly, novelist Michael Peterson, who had been convicted in 2003 of murdering his wife, entered an Alford plea in 2017 to resolve the case against him. Peterson's case had been the subject of the 2004 documentary series The Staircase and other media scrutiny, and Peterson continued to challenge his conviction based on alleged law enforcement misconduct and judicial errors. He was eventually granted a new trial, but then agreed to enter an Alford plea to the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter instead. The judge then imposed a sentence that, after being reduced to account for time already served, resulted in Peterson serving no additional time in prison.[37] A 2022 scripted drama miniseries, also called The Staircase, portrayed the events of the case, including the legal battle and Alford plea.[37]\n\nIn his book American Criminal Justice (1972), Jonathan D. Casper comments: \"The Alford decision recognizes the plea-bargaining system, acknowledging that a man may maintain his innocence but still plead guilty in order to minimize his potential loss.\"[40] Casper comments on the impact of the Supreme Court's decision to require evidence of guilt in such a plea: \"By requiring that there be some evidence of guilt in such a situation, the decision attempts to protect the 'really' innocent from the temptations to which plea-bargaining and defense attorneys may subject them.\"[40]\n\nU.S. Air Force attorney Steven E. Walburn argues in a 1998 article in The Air Force Law Review that this form of guilty plea should be adopted for usage by the United States military.[18] \"In fairness to an accused, if, after consultation with his defense counsel, he knowingly and intelligently determines that his best interest is served by an Alford-type guilty plea, he should be free to choose this path. The system should not force him to lie under oath, nor to go to trial with no promise of the ultimate outcome concerning guilt or punishment. We must trust the accused to make such an important decision for himself. The military provides an accused facing court-martial with a qualified defense attorney. Together, they are in the best position to properly weigh what the impact his decision, and the resulting conviction, will have upon himself and his family.\"[18] He emphasizes that when allowing these pleas, \"trial counsel should establish as strong a factual basis as possible\", in order to minimize the possible negative outcomes to \"the public's perception of the administration of justice within the military\".[18]\n\nStephanos Bibas writes in a 2003 analysis for Cornell Law Review that Judge Frank H. Easterbrook and a majority of scholars \"praise these pleas as efficient, constitutional means of resolving cases\".[11] Bibas notes that prominent plea bargain critic Albert Alschuler supports the use of this form of plea: \"He views them as a lesser evil, a way to empower defendants within a flawed system. As long as we have plea bargaining, he maintains, innocent defendants should be free to use these pleas to enter advantageous plea bargains without lying. And guilty defendants who are in denial should be empowered to use these pleas instead of being forced to stand trial.\"[11] Bibas instead asserts that this form of plea is \"unwise and should be abolished\":[11] \"These procedures may be constitutional and efficient, but they undermine key values served by admissions of guilt in open court. They undermine the procedural values of accuracy and public confidence in accuracy and fairness, by convicting innocent defendants and creating the perception that innocent defendants are being pressured into pleading guilty. More basically, they allow guilty defendants to avoid accepting responsibility for their wrongs.\"[11]\n\nLegal scholar Jim Drennan, an expert on the court system at the Institute of Government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told the Winston-Salem Journal in a 2007 interview that the ability to use this form of guilty plea as an option in courts had a far-reaching effect throughout the United States: \"We have lots of laws, but human interaction creates unique circumstances and the law has to adapt.\"[21] He added that the Supreme Court \"had to make a decision about what to do. One of the things the court has to do is figure out how to answer new questions, and that is what happened in this case.\"[21]\n\nCommon criticisms of Alford pleas include harm to victims who are denied justice, harm to society from lack of respect for the criminal justice system, the incentive for coercion, violating the right against self-incrimination, hindering rehabilitation by avoiding treatment, and the arbitrary nature in which they are utilized, allowing a person to say one thing when they mean another.[41]\n• None McConville, Mike (1998). \"Plea Bargainings: Ethics and Politics\".

(2:26)\n\nEl boxeador mexicano Marco Verde ganó la medalla de plata en Paris 2024, te decimos los premios que recibirá por la presea\n\nMarco Verde rompió con los pronósticos del boxeo de los -71 kilogramos en Paris 2024. El boxeador llegó a la final y se llevó la medalla de plata, cuando en las prediciones era el bronce la presea que le asignaban al mexicano.\n\nEn el combate ante el uzbeco Asadkhuja Muydinkhujaev se jugó varios millones de pesos. El pugilista mexicano recibirá 3 millones 693 mil 460 pesos con la medalla plateada.\n\nLa bolsa de tres millones de pesos se da gracias a la suma de premios que da el gobierno mexicano, la iniciativa privada y Asociación Internacional de Boxeo, IBA por sus siglas en inglés.\n\nDe acuerdo con Ana Gabriela Guevara, titular de la CONADE, los medallistas de plata se llevarán un premio de dos millones de pesos, cifra que podría aumentar en caso de que el Presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, decida o anuncie un aumento a la cifra.\n\nAdemás de los dos millones de pesos, la IBA le entrega a los ganadores de medalla de plata un premio de 50 mil dólares, que equivale a 943 mil 460 pesos. Ese estímulo deportivo, Marco Verde lo debe de repartir: 25% de esa cantidad es para su entrenador y otro 25% para su federación, el resto 50% es para el atleta.\n\nTambién la iniciativa privada se suma a los premios para los medallistas olímpicos mexicanos. En el caso de la presea de plata que ganó Marco Verde, la Fundación Telmex entrega 250 mil pesos, mientras que las Farmacias Similares dan 500 mil por el metal plateado.\n\nEl gobierno estatal de Sinaloa prometió que también recompensará el esfuerzo del boxeador mexicano, pero no ha definido montos y tampoco mecanismos para entregarle un premio al atleta originario de esa entidad.\n\n¿Cuánto apoyo le entregó la CONADE a Marco Verde en el ciclo olímpico?\n\nLa CONADE le aportó a Marco Verde dos millones 469 mil pesos en el proceso rumbo a los Juegos Olímpicos de Paris 2024, por el concepto de becas y estímulos económicos.\n\nEl pugilista mexicano, que ganó la medalla de plata, apenas recibió 396 mil pesos por el concepto de becas en el ciclo olímpico, mientras que necesitó de sumar buenos resultados para garantizar un ingreso de dos millones 430 mil pesos por el concepto de estímulos económicos o premios, como el título panamericano en Santiago 2023, que le dio el pase a Juegos Olímpicos.Verner Weckman - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Johan Verner Weckman (26 de julio de 1882 - 22 de febrero de 1968) fue un luchador del deporte finlandés que compitió en los Juegos Olímpicos intercalados de 1906 y en los Juegos Olímpicos de 1908.\n\nNació en Loviisa en una familia de agricultores. Inspirado por los luchadores del circo, Weckman comenzó a practicar la lucha grecorromana y ganó su primer campeonato finlandés en 1904 contra Verner Järvinen.

Única nave de su clase, fue también el primer gran buque de guerra construido en Alemania tras la Primera Guerra Mundial. De acuerdo con la secuencia, fue el tercer buque de la armada alemana en ostentar dicho nombre, siendo su epónimo la ciudad de Emden, en la actual Baja Sajonia y por entonces integrada en el Estado Libre de Prusia.\n\nSu quilla fue puesta en grada en el astillero Reichsmarinewerft de Wilhelmshaven en diciembre de 1921, la botadura del casco se produjo en enero de 1925 y el crucero entró en servicio en la marina alemana en octubre de ese mismo año.\n\nSu diseño estuvo claramente delimitado por las restricciones estipuladas en el Tratado de Versalles y por los dictados de la comisión de desarme de los aliados. Así, fue armado con una batería principal de ocho cañones de 150 mm, todos excedentes de la guerra mundial, montados en torretas individuales, tal y como ordenaron los aliados. Su velocidad máxima era de 29 nudos (54 km/h).\n\nEl Emden actuó la mayor parte de su carrera como buque escuela y en el período de entreguerras realizó varios cruceros de adiestramiento para cadetes. Con el estallido de la Segunda Guerra Mundial fue empleado para crear campos de minas frente a las costas alemanas y resultó dañado por un bombardero británico que se estrelló contra el crucero.\n\nParticipó en la invasión de Noruega en abril de 1940, tras lo que regresó a su rol de buque escuela en el mar Báltico. Cumplió esta función con pequeñas interrupciones hasta septiembre de 1944, cuando fue desplegado en Noruega como buque insignia de las fuerzas alemanas destinadas a la colocación de minas.\n\nEn enero de 1945 transportó los restos exhumados de Paul von Hindenburg desde Prusia Oriental a Pillau para evitar que cayeran en manos soviéticas. Mientras era reparado en Kiel el Emden resultó gravemente dañado por un bombardeo británico y poco después sus tripulantes lo vararon y volaron a la entrada del puerto.\n\nLos restos del naufragio fueron desguazados para chatarra in situ durante los siguientes años, ​ ​ hasta 1949. La ornamentación de su proa se exhibe actualmente en el Deutsches Museum en Múnich. ​\n• None , Gerhard; , Klaus-Peter (2014). German Light Cruisers of World War II: Warships of the Kriegsmarine .

Como parte de una gira de buena voluntad promocionando los Juegos Olímpicos de Berlín. La tripulación del barco viajó en tren hasta la Ciudad de Guatemala, donde desfilaron ante militares de alto rango del gobierno del general Ubico y el público en general. ​\n\nDurante el gobierno del Tercer Reich (1933-1945) en Alemania, que coincidió casi por completo con el régimen de Ubico en términos temporales, hubo rumores que suponían que los alemanes en la Verapaz querían establecerse como una «nueva Alemania» con la política nacional socialista de Hitler. ​ Los alemanes habían adquirido terrenos, manzanas, casas y fincas gracias a las concesiones de los presidentes liberales que gobernaron de 1885 a 1920 en Guatemala, ​ y gozaron de privilegios durante el gobierno dictatorial del general Jorge Ubico, que simpatizaba con las políticas fascistas de Benito Mussolini en Italia, Francisco Franco en España y Adolf Hitler en Alemania. ​ ​\n\nUn incidente que afectó la existencia de la comunidad alemana verapacense fue cuando entre 1935 y 1936, el Tercer Reich pidió votar a sus ciudadanos sobre la anexión de Austria a Alemania: un barco alemán ancló en Puerto Barrios para efectuar la actividad y quienes asistieron fueron «fichados» como simpatizantes del régimen nazi de Adolf Hitler.[4]​ ​ ​\n\nEn la Ciudad de Guatemala en 1933, fue fundada la Deutsches Haus (Casa del Partido), y más tarde se fundaron también en Quetzaltenango, Cobán, Retalhuleu, Mazatenango y Puerto Barrios y los alemanes residentes en Guatemala fundaron la Asociación de Trabajo de la Mujer Alemana. Además, desde 1935, simpatizantes del partido se hicieron con el control del Deutsche Zeitung, periódico que había sido fundado por alemanes en 1931.[4]​[6]​\n\nEse mismo año, se fundaron las juventudes hitlerianas en el Colegio Alemán, se adoptó la práctica del saludo de Hitler y se trató de hacer valer la teoría nazi de los arios, sin percatarse de que el Colegio Alemán tenía estudiantes de padres judíos. Y aunque muchos de estos grupos se dedicaban a actividades fundamentalmente culturales y a conmemorar la celebración de algunas fechas muy importantes para el nacionalsocialismo como el cumpleaños del Führer, el ascenso de Hitler al poder y el Día del Trabajo; los alemanes simpatizantes con el régimen tuvieron conflictos con el resto de germanos residentes en Guatemala, que habían llegado al país en el siglo XIX y que ya habían establecido sus familias en el país.[4]​[6]​ Más tarde, en el año de 1937, Jorge Ubico recibió una carta del canciller alemán, Adolf Hitler, donde le felicitaba por su gobierno en Guatemala.[4]​[6]​\n\nLa tensión se incrementó en 1939 con el inicio de la Segunda Guerra Mundial tras la invasión alemana de Polonia, y llegó a un punto crítico cuando Japón atacó la base militar estadounidense de Pearl Harbor, lo que precipitó el ingreso de los Estados Unidos en el conflicto. ​ Estos últimos tenían una gran influencia en el gobierno guatemalteco, gracias a las concesiones otorgadas a las empresas norteamericanas como la United Fruit Company, que tenía el monopolio de la exportación de banano y por el que prácticamente no pagaba impuestos a Guatemala, y el transporte por ferrocarril por medio de su subsidiaria International Railroads of Central America (IRCA). La frutera era el pilar más fuerte del gobierno de Ubico y formaba parte de la política estadounidense que se había iniciado con el presidente Theodore Roosevelt durante las negociaciones con Colombia para la construcción del Canal de Panamá en 1903. ​ Como consecuencia, los Estados Unidos obligaron al presidente Jorge Ubico a expulsar a los alemanes de Guatemala y a intervenir todas sus propiedades.[8]​ ​ Los alemanes varones se vieron obligados a abandonar el país e ingresar en las filas del Ejército alemán. El historiador guatemalteco Francis Polo Sifontes cuenta que durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial muchos alemanes fueron llamados para prestar servicio militar en su país. Después de la guerra, algunos quedaron recluidos en los campos de concentración de Rusia, y otros alegaron ser guatemaltecos para evitar la prisión.[6]​ ​Emden las hazañas del famoso crucero alemán en los mares de Oriente – El Cazador: Título: Emden las hazañas del famoso crucero alemán en los mares de Oriente\n\n Autor: Hellmuth Von Mucke\n\n Páginas: 190\n\n Fotos: no\n\n Año de edición: 2009\n\n Medidas: 23cm x 15cm\n\n Tapa blanda\n\n Estado: Usado en excelente estado\n\n Idioma: Castellano"}

This was part of a joint military exercise between the two branches to strengthen national security and maintain readiness. (Courtesy photo)\n\nJoint military exercises involving multiple U.S. military branches play an important role in strengthening our national security and maintaining readiness. Such was the case for the collaboration between the U.S. Air Force’s 53rd Combat Airfield Operations Squadron from Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, and U.S. Marine Corps’ Marine Air Control Squadron 2 unit from Cherry Point, North Carolina, for an exercise at the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command and Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California, Jan. 5 - Feb. 24, 2024.\n\n“The mission of the 53rd CAOS is to provide austere airfield opening, precision approach capability and landing zone services at a moment’s notice anywhere in the world,” said U.S. Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Harley Brydon, 53rd CAOS senior enlisted leader. “It was important for CAOS to embed with the USMC so that we can practice interoperability in accordance with our techniques, tactics and procedures, including learning best practices regarding joint airfield opening post-airfield seizure, and how to do airspace and airfield status reporting in a joint combat environment.”\n\nThe Robins unit also learned about the radar program Air Traffic Navigation, Integration, and Coordination System, which the USMC has been operating for several years.\n\nTwentynine Palms, Ca. – U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jason Buck, standing, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt.

This was part of a joint military exercise between the 53rd CAOS and United States Marine Corps’ Marine Air Control Squadron 2 unit from Cherry Point, North Carolina. (Courtesy photo)\n\n“The Air Force’s partnership and collaboration with the Marine Corps is critical to our ability to produce joint fires and effects against adversaries in a high-end fight,” said Brydon. “It is critical for our units in each branch to be able to seamlessly integrate into each other’s formations at operating locations in a contested environment to meet operational requirements in a time of Great Power Competition.”\n\n“This collaboration is particularly important for the USMC and USAF air traffic control communities because they are such similar fields,” said Means. “There will always be opportunities, both in peacetime training and in combat, for us to work together and fill gaps that each service may have.”\n\nThe mission of MACS-2 is multifaceted in supporting both offensive and defensive air operations. MACS-2 is responsible for detecting and identifying hostile aircraft and missiles within their area of operation. Their radar systems and surveillance capabilities allow them to track and assess potential threats.\n\n“This gave our Marines and Airmen a chance to perform our function as a command-and-control node, pushing and pulling information throughout the exercise to decision makers and the tactical units engaged during the mission,” Means continued. “Having Marines and Airmen work together increases our confidence when working together in the future because we will have a common experience to draw upon.”\n\nTwentynine Palms, Ca. – U.S. Air Force Airmen with the 53rd Combat Airfield Operations Squadron from Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, and members of the U.S. Marine Corps’ Marine Air Control Squadron 2 unit from Cherry Point, North Carolina, participate in a joint airfield exercise at Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center, California, Jan. 5 - Feb. 24, 2024.

Este entró en vigor el 28 de abril de 1952. Su nombre en español es Tratado de Paz con Japón.\n\nEste tratado sirvió para terminar oficialmente la Segunda Guerra Mundial, acabar formalmente con la posición de Japón como una potencia imperial, asignar compensación a civiles aliados y antiguos prisioneros de guerra que habían sufrido crímenes de guerra japoneses, terminar la ocupación militar aliada y devolver la soberanía a Japón. Este tratado hizo uso extenso de la Carta de Naciones Unidas y la Declaración Universal de Derechos Humanos para articular los objetivos de los Aliados.\n\nSe dice que este tratado, junto con el Tratado de Seguridad firmado aquel mismo día, marca el principio del \"Sistema de San Francisco\", este término, acuñado por el historiador John Dower, establece los efectos de la relación de Japón con los Estados Unidos y su papel en la arena internacional como determinados por estos dos tratados y es usado para hablar de las maneras en las que estos efectos han gobernado la historia de posguerra de Japón.\n\nArabia Saudita, Argentina, Australia, Bélgica, Bolivia, Brasil, Camboya, Canadá, Ceilán, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Checoslovaquia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estados Unidos, Etiopía, Filipinas, Francia, Guatemala, Haití, Honduras, Indonesia, Irán, Laos, Líbano, Liberia, Luxemburgo, México, Nicaragua, Noruega, Nueva Zelanda, Países Bajos, Pakistán, Panamá, Paraguay, Perú, Polonia, Reino de Egipto, Reino de Grecia, Reino de Irak, Reino Unido de Gran Bretaña e Irlanda del Norte, República Dominicana, Siria, Turquía, Unión Soviética, Unión Sudafricana, Uruguay, Venezuela, Estado de Vietnam y Japón.\n\nBirmania, India y Yugoslavia también fueron invitadas, pero no participaron. Ni la República de China en Taiwán ni la República Popular de China continental fueron invitadas debido a la guerra civil china y la controversia sobre cuál de los dos gobierno era el legítimo. Tampoco fueron invitadas Corea del Norte y Corea del Sur debido al mismo problema. Tampoco fue invitado Portugal a pesar de haber sido invadido su territorio de Timor Oriental por Japón, habiendo permanecido neutral en la guerra.\n\n48 países participantes firmaron el tratado. Checoslovaquia, Polonia y la Unión Soviética se negaron a firmarlo. Indonesia firmó el tratado, pero no lo ratificó.\n\nEl documento oficialmente renuncia los derechos de tratado de Japón obtenidos del Protocolo Bóxer de 1901 y sus derechos a Corea, Formosa (Taiwán), Hong Kong (una colonia británica), las Islas Kuriles, las Islas Pescadores, las Islas Spratly, Antártida y la isla de Sajalín. El tratado no declara formalmente qué naciones son soberanas en estas áreas, una cuestión que algunos partidarios de la independencia de Taiwán usan para justificar la autodeterminación taiwanesa según el Artículo 77b de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, que aplica administraciones fiduciarias \"a territorios que pueden ser separados de Estados enemigos a consecuencia de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\" Sin embargo, excepto las Ryūkyū, las áreas sobre las cuales Japón renunció a la soberanía nunca fueron traídas conforme a ningún arreglo de administración fiduciaria de Naciones Unidas formal y de ahí las especificaciones del Artículo 77 no fueron aplicadas.\n\nEl artículo 3 del tratado formalmente pone a las islas Ryukyu, que incluyen Okinawa y los grupos de islas Amami, Miyako y Yaeyama, bajo la administración fiduciaria estadounidense. Las Islas Amami fueron traspasadas finalmente a Japón el 25 de diciembre de 1953 y en 1969 las negociaciones de Estados Unidos con Japón autorizaron la transferencia de autoridad sobre las Ryukyu a Japón para ser puesta en práctica en 1972. En 1972, \"la reversión\" de los Estados Unidos de las Ryukyu ocurrió junto con el traspaso del control de las Islas Senkaku (deshabitadas) cercanas sin adoptar una actitud en la soberanía última de las Islas Senkaku, que son reclamadas tanto por la República Popular de China como por la República de China (Taiwán).\n\nPor el Artículo 11 Japón aceptó los juicios del Tribunal Militar Internacional para el Lejano Oriente y de otros Tribunales Aliados de Crímenes de Guerra, ambos dentro y fuera de Japón y consintió en cumplir las sentencias impuestas así sobre ciudadanos japoneses encarcelados en Japón.\n\nEl documento posterior puso pautas para la repatriación de prisioneros de guerra y renuncia a la futura agresión militar conforme a las pautas puestas por la Carta de Naciones Unidas. El documento anula tratados previos y pone el marco para el estatus actual de Japón de conservar unas fuerzas armadas que son puramente defensivas en naturaleza.\n\nHay también un poco de ambigüedad en cuanto a qué islas Japón ha renunciado la soberanía. Esto ha conducido tanto al conflicto de las Islas Kuriles como a la disputa de las islas Diaoyutai/Senkaku.\n\nNi la República Nacionalista de China ni la República Popular comunista de China fueron invitadas a la Conferencia de Paz de San Francisco y por lo tanto ninguno firmó este tratado. La República de China (Taiwán), sin embargo, firmó un Tratado separado de Taipéi con Japón en 1952, que reconoció los términos del Tratado de San Francisco.\n\nAlgunos partidarios de la independencia de Taiwán sostienen que el Tratado de San Francisco justifica la independencia de Taiwán porque no concede explícitamente Taiwán a la República de China o a la República Popular de China. Esta justificación legal es rechazada tanto por el gobierno de la República de China como por el de la República Popular, los cuales ambos basan sus reclamaciones legales sobre Taiwán en el Acta de Rendición de Japón que, argumentan, incorpora la Declaración de Potsdam y la Declaración de El Cairo. Además, en años más recientes, partidarios de la independencia de Taiwán más a menudo confiaban en argumentos basados en autodeterminación y soberanía popular y menos en argumentos puramente legales.\n\nLa Unión Soviética rechazó firmar el Tratado de San Francisco. Ningún tratado de paz separado ha sido firmado con Japón hasta después de que la Unión Soviética sufrió un colapso en 1991. Esto ha impedido que las disputas territoriales ruso-japonesas hayan sido resueltas.\n\nLos activos extranjeros japoneses se refieren a todos los activos poseídos por el gobierno japonés, firmas, organización y ciudadanos privados, en países colonizados u ocupados. De acuerdo con la Cláusula 14 del Tratado, las fuerzas Aliadas confiscaron todos los activos extranjeros japoneses, excepto aquellos en China, que fueron tratados con conforme a la Cláusula 21. China poseyó de nuevo todos los activos japoneses en Manchuria y Mongolia Interior, que incluyó trabajos mineros e infraestructura de ferrocarril. Además, la Cláusula 4 del tratado declaró que \"la disposición de propiedad de Japón y de sus ciudadanos ... y sus reclamaciones ... contra las autoridades que actualmente administran tales áreas y los residentes ... será el sujeto de arreglos especiales entre Japón y tales autoridades.\" Por consiguiente, se considera que Corea también tuvo derecho a los derechos proporcionados por la Cláusula 21.\n\nActivos extranjeros japoneses en 1945 (1945, ¥15=1US$- dólar de Estados Unidos)\n\nLa cláusula 16 del Tratado de San Francisco señala:\n\nEn señal de su deseo de indemnizar a aquellos miembros de las fuerzas armadas de los Poderes Aliados que sufrieron privaciones excesivas mientras los prisioneros de guerra del Japón, Japón transferirá sus activos y aquellos de sus ciudadanos en países que eran neutros durante la guerra, o que estaban en la guerra con cualquiera de los Poderes Aliados, o, a su opción, el equivalente de tales activos, al Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja que liquidará tales activos y distribuirá el fondo consiguiente para asignar agencias nacionales, a beneficio de antiguos prisioneros de guerra y sus familias en tal base cuando esto puede determinar de ser equitativo. Las categorías de activos descritos en el Artículo 14 (a) 2 (II) (ii) por (de v) del Tratado presente serán excluidas de transferencia, así como activos de personas naturales japonesas no residentes de Japón en la primera entrada en vigor del Tratado. Es igualmente entendido que la provisión de transferencia de este Artículo no tiene ninguna aplicación a las 19,770 acciones en el Banco para Establecimientos Internacionales actualmente poseídos por instituciones financieras japonesas.\n\nEn consecuencia, Japón pagó £ 4,500,000 a la Cruz Roja.\n\nLa cláusula 14 del tratado declaró que \"Japón firmará puntualmente negociaciones con Poderes Aliados tan deseosos, cuyos territorios presentes fueron ocupados por fuerzas japonesas y dañados por Japón, con miras a la asistencia a compensar aquellos países para el coste de reparar el daño hecho, poniendo los servicios a disposición de las personas japonesas en la producción, salvando y otro trabajo para los Poderes Aliados en cuestión.\"\n\nEn consecuencia, Filipinas y Vietnam del Sur recibieron la compensación en 1956 y 1959 respectivamente. Birmania e Indonesia no eran signatarios originales, pero ellos más tarde firmaron el tratado bilateral de acuerdo con la Cláusula 14 del Tratado de San Francisco.\n\nCompensación japonesa a los países ocupados durante 1941–45\n\nEl último pago fue hecho a Filipinas el 22 de julio de 1976.La Conferencia de San Francisco | Naciones Unidas: Delegados de cincuenta naciones se reunieron en San Francisco entre el 25 de abril y el 26 de junio de 1945 en la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre Organización Internacional. Trabajando en las propuestas de Dumbarton Oaks, el Acuerdo de Yalta y las enmiendas propuestas por varios gobiernos, la Conferencia acordó la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y el Estatuto de la Nueva Corte Internacional de Justicia. Cuarenta y seis naciones, comprendidas las que habían apadrinado la conferencia, fueron invitadas a San Francisco; todas ellas habían declarado la guerra a Alemania y al Japón y habían suscrito la Declaración de las Naciones Unidas. Sólo una - Polonia - no concurrió debido a que la formación de su nuevo gobierno no llegó oportunamente a conocimiento de la conferencia. Por tanto, se dejó un espacio en blanco para la firma de dicho país, que se contaba entre los signatarios originales de la declaración. Cuando se reunió la conferencia no existía un gobierno polaco universalmente reconocido, mas, a su advenimiento el 28 de junio de 1945, se allanó este obstáculo, y el 15 de octubre del mismo año dicho país firmó la Carta y se convirtió en uno de los miembros originarios. La conferencia invitó directamente a cuatro estados más: la R.S.S. de Bielorrusia, la R.S.S. de Ucrania, Dinamarca, que acababa de ser liberada, y Argentina. En esta forma, los delegados de cincuenta naciones, que representaban un ochenta por ciento de la población total del mundo, se reunieron en la Conferencia de San Francisco en abril de 1945. Documental sobre la Conferencia de San Francisco y la firma de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas.\n\nLos trabajos de la Conferencia de San Francisco se organizaron como se indica a continuación. El órgano supremo fue la Conferencia en sesión plenaria, que estuvo a cargo de la votación y aprobación finales del texto. Por debajo del plenario, se establecieron cuatro comités:\n• El Comité Directivo, integrado por los presidentes de todas las delegaciones, que examinó las principales cuestiones de política y procedimiento;\n• El Comité Ejecutivo, integrado por los presidentes de 14 delegaciones (las de los cuatro gobiernos patrocinadores y diez miembros coelegidos), que prestó servicios al Comité Directivo preparando recomendaciones para su examen;\n• El Comité de Coordinación, integrado por miembros técnicos de las mismas 14 delegaciones, que prestó asistencia al Comité Ejecutivo y que contó, a su vez, con la asistencia de un Comité Asesor de Juristas; y\n• El Comité de Verificación de Poderes, formado por representantes de seis delegaciones, que verificó las credenciales de los delegados. Reunión del Comité Directivo el 10 de mayo de 1945 en San Francisco. Mesa central, de izquierda a derecha: Bitwodded Makonnen Endalkachau, Etiopía; Camilo Ponce Enríquez, Ecuador; y asesor. Foto ONU/Eastman Por debajo de este nivel, el estudio de las cuestiones más importantes que debían resolverse se dividió entre cuatro comisiones generales, que coordinaron la labor de doce comités técnicos, encargados de la preparación de propuestas de redacción; cuando hacía falta, los comités técnicos podían designar subcomités. Los trabajos se organizaron de la manera siguiente:\n• La Comisión I (Disposiciones Generales) coordinó los trabajos del Comité Técnico 1 (Preámbulo, Propósitos y Principios) y el Comité Técnico 2 (Miembros, Reforma y Secretaría);\n• La Comisión II (Asamblea General) coordinó los trabajos del Comité Técnico 1 (Estructura y Procedimientos), el Comité Técnico 2 (Funciones Políticas y de Seguridad), el Comité Técnico 3 (Cooperación Económica y Social) y el Comité Técnico 4 (Régimen de Administración Fiduciaria);\n• La Comisión III (Consejo de Seguridad), coordinó los trabajos del Comité Técnico 1 (Estructura y Procedimientos), el Comité Técnico 2 (Arreglo Pacífico), el Comité Técnico 3 (Disposiciones en materia de Aplicación) y el Comité Técnico 4 (Acuerdos Regionales); y\n• La Comisión IV (Organización Judicial), coordinó los trabajos del Comité Técnico 1 (Corte Internacional de Justicia) y el Comité Técnico 2 (Problemas Jurídicos). Una Secretaría prestó servicios de administración general a la Conferencia. En paralelo a esta estructura oficial, se celebraron consultas oficiosas entre las delegaciones, en particular entre las cinco potencias principales asistentes a la Conferencia (los Estados Unidos, el Reino Unido, la URSS, China y Francia). En la Conferencia se examinaron más de cinco mil documentos y se publicó una recopilación de los documentos principales con el título Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, volúmenes I a XX, 1945-1954. La Carta de las Naciones Unidas, junto con el Estatuto de la Corte Internacional de Justicia, que forma parte integrante de la Carta, se aprobó por unanimidad al término de la Conferencia, el 25 de junio de 1945 en la Ópera de San Francisco, y se firmó al día siguiente en el auditorio del Teatro Herbst del Veterans War Memorial Building. Entró en vigor, de conformidad con el párrafo 3 de su Artículo 110, el 24 de octubre de 1945, tras el depósito de los instrumentos de ratificación de los cinco miembros permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad y una mayoría de los demás signatarios. Asistieron 850 delegados, que con sus asesores y colaboradores, y el personal de la secretaría, sumaban 3500. Fueron allá, además, 2500 representantes de la prensa, la radio y los noticieros cinematográficos, y observadores procedentes de numerosas organizaciones y sociedades. En suma, la conferencia de San Francisco fue una de las más importantes de la historia, y quizás también la mayor de las reuniones internacionales que jamás se hayan efectuado. Los jefes de delegación de los países que la convocaron, señores Anthony Eden, de la Gran Bretana, Edward Stettinius, de los Estados Unidos, T. V. Soong, de China, y Vyacheslav Molotov, de la Unión Soviética, se turnaron en la presidencia de las sesiones plenarias. En reuniones posteriores, lord Halifax reemplazo al señor Eden, el Sr. V. K. Wellington al Sr. T. V. Soong, y el señor Gromyko al señor Molotov.\n\nEn conferencias de esta índole, las sesiones plenarias constituyen siempre la etapa final, pues antes de que en ellas se someta a votación cualquier proposición, es necesario realizar una gran suma de trabajo en las comisiones preparatorias. El procedimiento de votación que se empleo en San Francisco es de inusitada importancia, pues cada parte de la Carta tuvo que ser aprobada por una mayoría de dos tercios de los delegados. He aquí cómo pudo la conferencia de San Francisco terminar su gigantesca labor en sólo dos meses.\n\nLa existencia de las Naciones Unidas no se inició al firmarse la Carta. En muchos países ésta tuvo que ser sometida a la aprobación de sus respectivos congresos o parlamentos. Se había convenido en que la Carta entraría en efecto cuando la hubiesen ratificado los gobiernos de China, Francia, Gran Bretaña, la Unión Soviética, los Estados Unidos y la mayoría de los demás países signatarios, y cuando estos hubiesen notificado del hecho al departamento de estado de los Estados Unidos. El 24 de octubre de 1945 se habían llenado los requisitos, y las Naciones Unidas comenzaron a funcionar. Los proyectos de cuatro años y las esperanzas de muchos siglos acababan de cristalizar en una organización internacional encaminada a acabar con la guerra y promover la paz y la justicia y una vida mejor para toda la humanidad."}

With nine league championships and twelve Norwegian Cup wins, FFK is one of the most successful clubs in Norwegian football. The club was founded in 1903 and currently play in Eliteserien from 2024 after promotion from Norwegian First Division in 2023.\n\nAfter suffering relegation from the then 1st division in 1984, Fredrikstad spent 18 years outside the top flight, before returning to the top division in 2004 after two successive promotions.\n\nFredrikstad stadion was FFK's home ground between 1914 and 2006. However, its facilities were outdated and the club moved to a new stadium on the other side of river Glomma. Their new ground is located in a former shipyard, incorporating parts of the old buildings in the two side stands. FFK draw great support from their area and the official supporter club's name is Plankehaugen. More than 100 coaches filled with fans followed FFK to the cup final of 2006. The club's supporters include an Ultras section, Supras Fredrikstad. The club had for some years a casual mob, Brigade Rød-Hvit (Brigade Red - White) which was active in the hooligan scene in Norway.\n\nFredrikstad Fotballklubb was founded on 7 April 1903. While football in many older clubs was an addition to other established forms of sport, such as skiing or athletics, FFK was the first club in Norway to focus uniquely on playing football, and as such may be labeled the first true football club in the country. A lack of opposition meant this was in fact the third attempt at establishing a football club in Fredrikstad (tradition has it that the second attempt died out when the only football landed on a freight train bound for Moss). Finding someone in the vicinity to play against was still a problem when FFK was founded.\n\nIt so happened that the Englishman H. W. Kenworthy, who lived in the neighboring town of Sarpsborg, wanted to practice his native country's sport and traveled to Fredrikstad to take part in one of FFK's training sessions. Upon his return to Sarpsborg, it was suggested that he arrange for a new club to be established. The idea was well received in Sarpsborg, and Sarpsborg F.C. was founded on 8 May 1903. The first match between the teams was played the following year in Sarpsborg in front of 600 spectators. FFK won the historical match 4–0. Sarpsborg and Fredrikstad went on to establish the first regional series and inspired the founding of many new clubs in the region in the years to come.\n\nFFK didn't have the red and white colors when the club was founded in 1903. In fact, they changed suits seven times from 1903 to 1927. The colors that they wear now come from Polish National team. When FFK asked Polish Football Association if they could use their colours, they received positive reply and even set of clothes in the colours as a gift.\n\nFFK reached the Norwegian Cup final for the first time in 1932. The semifinal against Mjøndalen was played at home in front of a record 9,000 spectators, and FFK won the match 3–0. Fredrikstad met Ørn Horten in the final, winning 6–1, and were thus Norwegian Champions. This signaled the start of Fredrikstad's first successful era, in which the club claimed four more cup titles before the start of World War II. FFK became the first club to win the new nationwide league, in 1937–38, and they won The Double the following season.\n\nIn the 1930s, the club also had an active bandy department.[2]\n\nDuring the German occupation no organized football took place, as a result of all athletes going on strike in support of the resistance. After the war football was more popular than ever, and Fredrikstad set another attendance record against Sarpsborg in the semifinal of the 1945 Norwegian Cup. There was, however, little success on the pitch. FFK reached three cup finals in four years but lost all of them. The break came in 1949 when FFK won its third league title.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were highly successful years for FFK. The club secured the league title six times – back to back in 1950–51 and 1951–52 – and finished in second place seven times. The Norwegian Cup was won four times. In 1957, a new milestone was achieved when FFK won their second double. As league champions in 1960, Fredrikstad entered the European Cup as the first team from Norway, sensationally defeating Ajax 4–3 at home and drawing 0–0 in Amsterdam, in the first round.\n\nThe town of Fredrikstad was in many ways an economic powerhouse in Norway in the previous century, first as a major supplier of machinery to the timber industry and then as a center of shipbuilding activities. At one point the shipyard in Fredrikstad was the largest in Scandinavia. It has been said that there was always an air of optimism surrounding the town and its inhabitants, and it was certainly reflected in FFK's playful and relaxed style of football, which many regarded as the most entertaining in the country. The club's first cup triumph in '32 even made Jørgen Juve, a legend in Norwegian football, state: \"This is how football is supposed to be played.\"\n\nPerhaps it was because of this relaxed atmosphere that the club was so successful, and also why it eventually fell into decline. After years of glory, the club was becoming conservative, although they would not admit it themselves. Other clubs were increasingly turning to professionalism, while players from FFK still played football in addition to having normal jobs. Training regimes were becoming more rigorous than before, but in Fredrikstad, they felt that training more than twice a week would ruin the joy of playing football. There is also the sentiment that, in light of the club's formidable history, newer generations of FFK players were given too much responsibility, folding to the pressure again and again whenever things were starting to look brighter.\n\nFredrikstad was to struggle throughout the 1970s. They reached the cup final in 1971 but lost to Rosenborg, who was by now firmly en route to becoming a giant in Norwegian football. In 1972, they were runners-up in the league to Viking FK only on goal difference, as both teams finished the season on 34 points.[3] In 1973, for the first time in the club's history, FFK was relegated. They immediately gained promotion via the playoffs and by 1975 were back in the highest division, where they stayed for two seasons before facing relegation yet again.\n\nThe elevator ride between divisions continued until 1984. The Norwegian Cup went to Fredrikstad that year, but it must have been a bittersweet success. The club was once again relegated, and this time they were unable to make it back to the top flight. In 1992, FFK was relegated to the third highest division, where they would languish until 2002.\n\nFredrikstad's comeback from obscurity is largely attributed to the manager Knut Torbjørn Eggen, who introduced a degree of professionalism the club had previously lacked. During his tenure, from 2001 until the end of 2006, the son of Rosenborg's successful former coach led the team to their first title in more than two decades. In 2002, they were promoted from the 2. divisjon to the 1. divisjon, and in 2003, their centenary year, Fredrikstad finished second, earning promotion to the top division. Although struggling to maintain their form through an entire season, Fredrikstad has managed to retain their spot three times, and in 2006 they won the Norwegian Cup for the eleventh time in their history. They came 2nd and won silver in the 2008 season, but were relegated after a poor season in 2009 to 1. division. They eventually got promoted back to Tippeligaen through playoffs in November 2010 by first beating Løv-Ham 2–0, then Hønefoss BK with a stunning 8–1 goal difference over two matches.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, the offices of the club were raided by Norwegian police in connection with the Raio Piiroja contract investigations[4]\n\nAfter their relegation from the Eliteserien in 2012, Fredrikstad spent time in the Obos-Ligaen (2012-2017, 2021-2023) and PostNord-ligaen (2018-2020) before earning promotion back to the Eliteserien in 2024 under new manager Mikkjal Thomassen.\n\nIn the early years of the club, Fredrikstad changed attire quite frequently. The first kit, for example, consisted of blue and white striped shirts and black shorts, but was changed after only two years, to white shirts and blue shorts. In 1910, a green and white kit was adopted ahead of the club's first semifinal in the Norwegian Cup.\n\nThe seventh and final iteration of Fredrikstad's kit was introduced after a match between Norway and Poland at Fredrikstad stadion, on 7 October 1926. Fredrikstad would request of the Polish Football Association that they use the Polish national colors for the Polish national team:\n\nThe club received from the Polish association the new kit on 17 March 1927, when it became the official colors of Fredrikstad. The kit has since changed little in appearance apart from the socks, which went from being red and white to purely white in 1997.\n\nFFK's badge, a green and white streamer with a football and the initials F.F. (the original abbreviation for Fredrikstad Fotballklubb was F.F.), has remained virtually unchanged since its introduction in 1909. When the Fredrikstad kit changed to white and red, the colors of the streamer changed as well.\n\nThe old Fredrikstad stadion was inaugurated in 1914 and was the first stadium in Norway with floodlighting. FFK's record attendance was set in 1956 against Larvik Turn. 15,534 spectators showed up for this quarter-final match of the Norwegian Cup. The stadium's last renovation occurred ahead of the 2004 season, putting the capacity at around 10,500.\n\nA new home ground was built for the 2007 season at Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted (colloquially known as \"Værste\"), an old shipyard in the center of Fredrikstad. This was once the largest shipyard in Scandinavia, and the architecture of the stadium is such that two of the now defunct mechanical workshops, dating from as far back as 1870, are converted into stands at the sides. In addition, two separate stands are built at the ends of the pitch. The new stadium (with the same name, Fredrikstad stadion) has an all-seater capacity of 12,550.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

The British defeated the Continental Army and gained access to the strategically important Port of New York, which they held for the rest of the war. It was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared its independence on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia. It was the largest battle of the Revolutionary War in terms of both troop deployment and combat.\n\nAfter defeating the British in the siege of Boston on March 17, Continental Army commander-in-chief George Washington relocated his army to defend the port city of New York, located at the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the Royal Navy, so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British, under the command of General William Howe, landed a few miles across the harbor on the sparsely populated Staten Island, where they were reinforced by a fleet of ships in Lower New York Bay over the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and accordingly moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that it would be the first target.\n\nOn August 21, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south of the established East River crossings to Manhattan. After five days of waiting, the British attacked the American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and capture, although a stand by 400 Maryland and Delaware troops prevented greater losses. The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege, but on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life. The Continental Army was driven out of Manhattan entirely after several more defeats and was forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the first stage of the war, the British Army was trapped in the peninsular city of Boston and were forced to abandon it on March 17, sailing to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to await reinforcements.[7] Washington then began to transfer regiments to New York City, which he believed the British would attack next because of the port's strategic importance.[8][9] He had sent his second-in-command, Charles Lee, ahead to New York the previous February to establish the city's defenses.[10] Washington left Boston on April 4, arrived in New York on April 13,[11] and established headquarters at the former home of Archibald Kennedy on Broadway facing Bowling Green.\n\nLee remained in New York City until March when the Continental Congress sent him to South Carolina; construction of the city's defenses was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling).[11] Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found the defenses incomplete,[12] but Lee had concluded that in any case, it would be impossible to hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He reasoned that the defenses should be located with the ability to inflict heavy casualties upon the British if any move was made to take and hold ground.[10] Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling was built across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city.[13] Lee had also seen to it that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.[14]\n\nWashington began moving troops to Brooklyn in early May,[15] and there were several thousand of them there in a short time. Three more forts were under construction on the eastern side of the East River to support Fort Stirling, which stood to the west of the hamlet of Brooklyn Heights. These new fortifications were Fort Putnam,[16] Fort Greene,[16] and Fort Box[16] (named for Major Daniel Box).[17] They lay from north to south, with Fort Putnam farthest to the north, Greene slightly to the southwest, and Box slightly farther southwest. Each of these defensive structures was surrounded by a large ditch, all connected by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons.[18]\n\nFort Defiance was also being constructed at this time, located farther southwest, past Fort Box, near present-day Red Hook.[17] In addition to these new forts, a mounted battery was established on Governors Island, cannons were placed at Fort George facing Bowling Green on Manhattan, and more cannons were placed at the Whitehall Dock, which sat on the East River.[19] Hulks were sunk at strategic locations to deter the British from entering the East River and other waterways.[20]\n\nWashington had been authorized by Congress to recruit an army of up to 28,501 troops, but he had only 19,000 when he reached New York.[21] Military discipline was inadequate; routine orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints were ruined, bayonets were used as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness was lax.[22] Petty internal conflict was common under the strain of a large number of people from different regional cultures and temperaments living in relatively close proximity.[23]\n\nCommander of the artillery Henry Knox persuaded Washington to transfer 400 to 500 soldiers, who lacked muskets or guns, to crew the artillery.[19] In early June, Knox and General Nathanael Greene inspected the land at the north end of Manhattan and decided to establish Fort Washington. Fort Constitution, later renamed Fort Lee, was planned opposite Fort Washington on the Hudson River.[19] The forts were intended to discourage the British ships from sailing up the Hudson River.[19]\n\nOn June 28, General Washington learned that the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and was heading toward New York.[24] On June 29, signals were sent from men stationed on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay.[25] The population of New York went into a panic at the sight of the British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts.[25] On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The Continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.[26] Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island under the command of Richard Howe, the brother of General Howe.[26]\n\nOn July 6, news reached New York that Congress had voted for independence four days earlier.[27] On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the commons of the city to hear the Declaration of Independence read. After the end of the reading, a mob ran down to Bowling Green with ropes and bars, where they tore down the gilded lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain.[28] In their fury, the crowd cut off the statue's head, severed the nose, mounted what remained of the head on a spike outside a tavern, and the rest of the statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.[29]\n\nOn July 12, the British ships Phoenix and Rose sailed up the harbor toward the mouth of the Hudson.[29] The American batteries opened fire from the harbor defenses of Fort George, Fort Defiance, and Governors Island, but the British returned fire into the city. The ships sailed along the New Jersey shore and continued up the Hudson, sailing past Fort Washington and arriving by nightfall at Tarrytown, the widest part of the Hudson.[30] The goals of the British ships were to cut off American supplies from New England and the north and to encourage Loyalist support. The only casualties of the day were six Americans who were killed when their own cannon blew up.[30]\n\nThe next day, July 13, Howe attempted to open negotiations with the Americans.[31] He sent a letter to Washington delivered by Lieutenant Philip Brown, who arrived under a flag of truce. The letter was addressed to \"George Washington, Esq.\"[31] Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who had hurried to the waterfront on Washington's orders, accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no.[32] Reed told Brown that there was no one in the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address \"George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.\", but it was again declined.[33] The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20.[33] Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons, but Washington said, \"Those who have committed no fault want no pardon.\"[33] Patterson departed soon after.[33] Washington's performance during the meeting was praised in many parts of the country.[34]\n\nMeanwhile, British ships continued to arrive.[35] On August 1, 45 ships arrived with generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis, along with 3,000 troops. By August 12, 3,000 more British troops and another 8,000 Hessians had arrived.[36] At this point, the British fleet numbered over 400 ships, including 73 warships, and 32,000 troops were camped on Staten Island. Faced with this large force, Washington was unsure as to where the British would attack.[37] Both Greene and Reed thought that the British would attack Long Island, but Washington felt that a British attack on Long Island might be a diversion for the main attack on Manhattan. He broke his army in half, stationing half of it on Manhattan, and the other half on Long Island; the army on Long Island was commanded by Greene.[37] On August 20, Greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in Manhattan where he rested to recover. John Sullivan was placed in command until Greene was well enough to resume command.[38]\n\nAt 05:10 on August 22, an advance guard of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island under the command of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island.[39] At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed on the shore of Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been stationed on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way.[40] By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops. Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.[40][41]\n\nWashington received word of the landings the same day but was informed that the number was 8,000 to 9,000 troops.[42] This convinced him that it was the feint that he had predicted and therefore he only sent 1,500 more troops to Brooklyn, bringing the total number of troops on Long Island to 6,000. On August 24, Washington replaced Sullivan with Israel Putnam who commanded the troops on Long Island.[43] Putnam arrived on Long Island the next day along with six battalions. Also that day, the British troops on Long Island received 5,000 Hessian reinforcements, bringing their total to 20,000.[44] There was little fighting on the days immediately after the landing, although some small skirmishes did take place with American marksmen armed with rifles picking off British troops from time to time.[45]\n\nThe American plan was for Putnam to direct the defenses from Brooklyn Heights, while Sullivan and Stirling and their troops would be stationed forward on the Guan Heights.[46][47] The Guan (hills) were up to 150 feet high and blocked the most direct route to Brooklyn Heights.[46][47] Washington believed that, by stationing men on the heights, heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell back to the main defenses at Brooklyn Heights.[48] There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road farthest to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly farther to the east, in the center of the American line where it was expected that the British would attack, and the Bedford Pass even further to the east. Stirling was responsible for defending the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively.[46] Six-thousand troops were to remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known path through the heights called the Jamaica Pass, farthest to the east, which was patrolled by just five militia officers on horseback.[49]\n\nOn the British side, General Clinton learned of the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists.[50] He drew up a plan and gave it to William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton's plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank, while other troops would keep the Americans busy in front.[51] On August 26, Clinton received word from Howe that the plan would be used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant's British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, were to attack the Americans in front to distract them from the main army coming on their flank.[51] Howe told Clinton to be ready to move out that night, August 26.[51]\n\nAt 21:00, the British moved out.[52] No one except the commanders knew of the plan. Clinton led a crack brigade of light infantry with fixed bayonets in front, followed by Cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces. Cornwallis was followed by Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage.[52] The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing was happening.[52] The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly north toward the heights.\n\nThe column had yet to run into any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as \"Howard's Half-Way House\"), just a few hundred yards from the Jamaica Pass.[53] Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). William Howard Jr. describes meeting Howe:\n\n\n\nFive minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia officers stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans.[54] Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest.[54] At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.[54]\n\nAt about 23:00 on August 26, the first shots were fired in the Battle of Long Island, near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th Street and 4th Avenue). American pickets from Samuel John Atlee's Pennsylvania regiment fired upon two British soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near the inn.[56]\n\nAround 01:00 on August 27, the British approached the vicinity of the Red Lion with 200–300 troops. The American troops fired upon the British; after approximately two fusillades, they fled up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte–Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd had been in command, but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates.[57] This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.\n\nBrigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and Colonel Atlee were stationed farther north on the Gowanus Road. Parsons was a lawyer from Connecticut who had recently secured a commission in the Continental Army; Atlee was a veteran of the French and Indian War in command of the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry. Putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03:00 and told that the British were attacking through the Gowanus Pass.[59] He lit signals to Washington, who was on Manhattan, and then rode south to warn Stirling of the attack.[60]\n\nStirling led two units of Colonel John Haslet's 1st Delaware Regiment under the immediate command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Infantry under the immediate command of Major Mordecai Gist; both Haslet and Smallwood were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following close behind was Parson's Connecticut regiment with 251 men. Stirling led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee and stop the British advance. Stirling had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.[citation needed]\n\nStirling placed Atlee's men in an apple orchard owned by Wynant Bennett on the south side of the Gowanus Road near present-day 3rd Avenue and 18th Street. Upon the approach of the British, the Americans:\n\nStirling took up positions with the Delaware and Maryland regiments just to the north of Atlee's men on the slopes of a rise of land between 18th and 20th streets. Some of the Maryland troops were positioned on a small hill near today's 23rd Street, which the local Dutch called \"Blokje Berg\" (Dutch for cube or block hill). At the base of this hill, the Gowanus Road crossed a small bridge over a ditch which drained a marshy area. When the British advanced up the Gowanus Road, the American troops fired upon them from positions on the north side of the ditch. To their left was Colonel Peter Kachline's Pennsylvania regiment.\n\nJust to the southeast of Blokje Berg were a few hills; amongst them was a hill which is the highest point in King's County at 220 feet which came to be known as \"Battle Hill,\" in what is today Greenwood Cemetery by the cemetery's boundary of 23rd Street and 7th Avenue. The British attempted to outflank the American positions by taking this hill. The Americans tried to prevent the British move, sending troops under Parsons and Atlee to take the hill. The British got there first but the Americans were able to dislodge them in fierce fighting. Battle Hill was the site of especially brutal fighting, with the Americans inflicting the highest number of casualties against the British troops during the entire Battle of Long Island. Among those killed was British Colonel James Grant, which led the Americans to believe that they had killed General James Grant. He was alleged to have been shot by a Pennsylvanian rifleman who had been sniping at the British from up in a tree. Among the American dead was Pennsylvania Colonel Caleb Parry, who was killed while rallying his troops.\n\nThe Americans were still unaware that this was not the main British attack, in part due to the ferocity of the fighting and the number of British troops engaged.[63]\n\nThe Hessians, in the center under the command of General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines stationed at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan.[64] The Hessian brigades did not attack, as they were waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who were in the process of outflanking the American lines at that time. The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.\n\nHowe fired his signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass, while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear.[64] Sullivan left his advance guard to hold off the Hessians while he turned the rest of his force around to fight the British. Heavy casualties mounted between the Americans and the British, and men on both sides fled out of fear.[64] Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point, the Hessians had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed.[65] Hand-to-hand fighting followed, with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives. It was later claimed that Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the Hessians.[66] Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though he himself was captured.[65]\n\nAt 09:00, Washington arrived from Manhattan.[67] He realized that he had been wrong about a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan.[67] His location on the battlefield is not known because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights where he could view the battle.[68]\n\nStirling still held the line against Grant on the American right, to the west.[68] He held on for four hours, still unaware of the British flanking maneuver, and some of his own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians.[66][68] Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, from the south up the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, where the American defenses on Brooklyn Heights lay on the other side.[69]\n\nStirling ordered all of his troops to cross the creek, except a contingent of Maryland troops under the command of Gist. This group became known to history as the \"Maryland 400\", although they numbered about 260–270 men. Stirling and Gist led the troops in a rear-guard action against the overwhelming numbers of British troops, which surpassed 2,000 supported by two cannons.[69] Stirling and Gist led the Marylanders in two attacks against the British, who were in fixed positions inside and in front of the Vechte–Cortelyou House (known today as the \"Old Stone House\"). After the last assault, the remaining troops retreated across the Gowanus Creek. Some of the men who tried to cross the marsh were bogged down in the mud and under musket fire, and others who could not swim were captured. Stirling was surrounded and, unwilling to surrender to the British, broke through their lines to von Heister's Hessians and surrendered to them. Two hundred fifty six Maryland troops were killed in the assaults in front of the Old Stone House, and fewer than a dozen made it back to the American lines.[70] Washington watched from a redoubt on nearby Cobble Hill (intersection of today's Court Street and Atlantic Avenue) and reportedly said, \"Good God, what brave fellows I must this day lose.\"[69][note 1]\n\nContinental Army troops who were not killed or captured escaped behind the fortified American position at Brooklyn Heights. Howe then ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, despite the protests of many officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault on the entrenched American positions, choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions. He believed the Americans to be essentially trapped, with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy in control of the East River, which they would have to cross to reach Manhattan Island.[71][72]\n\nHowe's failure to press the attack and the reasons for it have been disputed. He may have wished to avoid the casualties that his army suffered when attacking the Continentals under similar circumstances at the Battle of Bunker Hill.[72] He may also have been giving Washington an opportunity to conclude that his position was hopeless and surrender, in the European gentleman-officer tradition. Howe told Parliament in 1779 that his essential duty was to avoid excessive British casualties for insufficient purpose, and capturing Brooklyn Heights would likely not have meant capturing the entire American army. \"The most essential duty I had to observe was, not wantonly to commit his majesty's troops, where the object was inadequate. I knew well that any considerable loss sustained by the army could not speedily, nor easily, be repaired. . . . The loss of 1,000, or perhaps 1,500 British troops, in carrying those lines, would have been but ill repaid by double that number of the enemy, could it have been supposed they would have suffered in that proportion.\"[73]\n\nWashington and the Continental Army were surrounded on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs.[74] As the day went on, the British began to dig trenches, slowly coming closer to the American defenses. By doing this, the British would not have to cross over open ground to assault the American defenses as they did in Boston the year before.[75] Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28,[74] and two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover's regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts responded to Washington, sending troops. Thomas Mifflin, who commanded the Pennsylvania troops after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington.[76] In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, rain began to fall, and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night.[77]\n\nAs the rain continued, Washington sent a letter instructing General William Heath, who was at Kings Bridge over the Harlem River between Manhattan and what is now The Bronx, to send every flat-bottomed boat and sloop without delay, in case battalions of infantry from New Jersey came to reinforce their position.[78] At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals. Mifflin advised Washington to retreat to Manhattan while Mifflin and his Pennsylvania regiments made up the rear guard, holding the line until the rest of the army had withdrawn.[78] The generals agreed unanimously with Mifflin that retreat was the best option and Washington had orders go out by the evening.[79]\n\nThe troops were told that they were to gather up all their ammunition and baggage and prepare for a night attack.[79] By 21:00, the sick and wounded began to move to the Brooklyn Ferry in preparation for evacuation. At 23:00, Glover and his Massachusetts men, who were sailors and fishermen, began to evacuate the troops.[80]\n\nAs more troops were evacuated, more were ordered to withdraw from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk.[80] Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate.[82] Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly.[83] Washington exclaimed \"Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us.\" Mifflin explained that he had been told that it was his turn to evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.[83]\n\nArtillery, supplies, and troops were all being evacuated across the river at this time but it was not going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came.[83] A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there did not seem to be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat.[75] At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan.[84] All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.[84]\n\nThe British were stunned to find that Washington and the Continental Army had escaped.[84] Later that day, on August 30, British troops occupied Washington and the Continental Army's fortifications. When news of the battle reached London, it led to many celebratory festivities.[85] Bells were rung across the city, candles were lit in windows, and King George III awarded Howe the Order of the Bath.[86]\n\nWashington's defeat, in the opinions of some, revealed his deficiencies as a military strategist. Splitting his forces resulted in his largely inexperienced generals misunderstanding the state of the battle, and his raw troops fled in disorder at the first shots.[87] However, Washington and the Continental Army's daring retreat later that night has been seen by some historians as one of General Washington's greatest military accomplishments.[20] Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.[88]\n\nHowe remained inactive for the next half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip's Bay.[89] The British quickly occupied the city. Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington.[90] Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.[91] On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, Nathan Hale was executed for spying.\n\nAt the time, it was by far the largest battle ever fought in North America.[71] If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe reported his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded.[4] The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured.[6] As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships in Wallabout Bay, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.[92]: 191\n\nHistorians believe that as many as 256 soldiers of the First Maryland Regiment under Colonel William Smallwood fell in the battle, about two-thirds of the regiment. It is known that they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave's exact location has been a mystery for 240 years.\n\nThe most significant legacy of the Battle of Long Island was that it showed there would be no easy victory, and that the war would be long and bloody.[92]: 2 The British took control of the strategically vital harbor and put New York City under military occupation until the treaty ending the war was signed. With the British military command in residence the city became the focal point for espionage and intelligence gathering. The area surrounding the city and the harbor remained in a near-constant state of conflict as a forage-war harassed the surrounding communities.\n• The Altar to Liberty: Minerva monument: The battle is commemorated with a monument, which includes a bronze statue of Minerva near the top of Battle Hill, the highest point of Brooklyn, in Green-Wood Cemetery. The statue was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull and unveiled in 1920. The statue stands in the northwest corner of the cemetery and gazes directly at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. In 2006, the Minerva statue was invoked in a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to the Statue of Liberty in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery and marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument. 93\n• The Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument: A freestanding Doric column in Fort Greene memorializing all those who died while kept prisoner on the British ships just off the shore of Brooklyn, in Wallabout Bay. 94\n• Soldiers' Monument – Milford, Connecticut. Memorializes the 200 seriously ill prisoners of the Battle of Long Island who were dumped on the beach at Milford the night of January 3, 1777. 92\n• The Old Stone House: A re-constructed farmhouse (c.1699) that was at the center of the Marylanders' delaying actions serves as a museum of the battle. It is located in J.J. Byrne Park, at Third Street and Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn, and features models and maps. 95\n• Prospect Park, Brooklyn, Battle Pass: along the eastern side of East Drive is a large granite boulder with a brass plaque affixed, and another marker lies near the road for the Dongan Oak, a very large and old tree felled to block the pass from the British advance. In addition, in the park resides the Line of Defense marker erected by the Sons of the American Revolution and, near the eastern edge of Long Meadow, the Maryland Monument & Maryland Memorial corinthian column. 96\n\nThere are currently 30 existing units in the U.S. Army with lineages that go back to the colonial and revolutionary eras. Five Army National Guard units (101st Eng Bn,[97] 125th MP Co,[98] 175th Inf,[99] 181st Inf[100] and 198th Sig Bn)[101] and one Regular Army Field Artillery battalion (1–5th FA)[102] are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Long Island.\n• American Revolutionary War §British New York counter-offensive.

En la Guerra de Independencia de Estados Unidos fue la primera gran batalla sucedida después que los estadounidenses proclamaran su independencia el 4 de julio de ese mismo año. Además, fue el mayor enfrentamiento de todo el conflicto.\n\nDespués de vencer a los británicos en el sitio de Boston el 17 de marzo, el comandante en jefe, general George Washington, llevó a su ejército a defender Nueva York, ubicada en el extremo sur de la isla de Manhattan. Washington entiende que el puerto de la ciudad sería una excelente base para la Royal Navy durante la campaña. Para impedirlo estableció defensas y esperó el ataque inglés. En julio, los británicos, comandados por el general William Howe, desembarcaron a pocos kilómetros del puerto, en la poco poblada Staten Island, donde un mes y medio después, reforzado por barcos de la bahía de Nueva York, reunió una fuerza de 32 000 hombres y 400 navíos —73 buques de guerra—.[5]​ Con el apoyo naval de su flota, Howe controló el acceso al puerto bloqueando The Narrows. Washington sabía que con esto le sería muy difícil retener la ciudad. Creyendo que Manhattan sería el primer objetivo movió al grueso de sus fuerzas de sus posiciones.\n\nEl 22 de agosto, los británicos desembarcaron en las playas de la bahía de Gravesend, al suroeste del condado de Kings County, pasando a través de The Narrows. Después de cinco días de espera atacaron las defensas norteamericanas de las alturas de Guan. Sin conocimiento de los estadounidenses, Howe había conseguido llevar a la mayoría de su tropa alrededor de un flanco y una retirada para atacar por sorpresa poco después. Los revolucionarios entraron en pánico, lo que provocó un 20 % de bajas entre sus fuerzas. Aunque la resistencia de 400 soldados de Maryland impidió que el grueso del Ejército Continental fuera capturado. El resto de las fuerzas estadounidenses se retiró a las alturas de Brooklyn. Mientras los británicos se preparaban para asediarlos, durante la noche del 29 al 30 de agosto, Washington evacuó a todo el ejército desde Manhattan sin perder sus suministros ni una sola vida.\n\nDe cualquier modo, Washington y su ejército habían sido expulsados de Nueva York completamente tras sufrir numerosas derrotas, debiendo retirarse a través de Nueva Jersey a Pensilvania. Nueva York se convirtió efectivamente en el centro político-militar británico para sus operaciones durante la guerra. Poco después se produjo la ejecución de Nathan Hale y pérdida de casi un cuarto de los edificios de la ciudad en el Gran Incendio. En las semanas siguientes, las fuerzas británicas ocuparon Long Island, pero Washington y sus hombres consiguieron recuperar la posición.\n• Wikimedia Commons alberga una categoría multimedia sobre Batalla de Long Island."}

Es tracta de famílies que presenten una gran diversitat i variació. Pel que fa al nombre d’espècies que les compo­nen, es poden trobar des de famílies molt grans, com els tirànids (tirà cardenal comú) o els furnàrids (cuaespinós bicolor), amb més de 400 i 300 espècies respectivament, fins a famílies monotípiques, repre­sentades únicament per un gènere i una espècie, com és el cas dels sapayoids (sapaioa), els ragològids (xiuladora pigallada) o els eupètids (eupeta). Pel que fa a la mida, tot i que els passeriformes solen ser ocells de dimensions petites, com l’acantisita bec d’alena, d’uns 8 cm de llargada, o el manaquí barbat collblanc, amb 11 cm aproximada­ment, també hi ha excepcions com el picatarta collblanc, d’uns 41 cm, o l’ocell lira superb, que pot arribar fins al metre de llargada.\n\nCadascuna de les famílies d’aquesta infografia s’il·lustra amb la imatge d’una espècie representativa i el nom científic i la denominació catalana corresponents.\n\nCada imatge ofereix un enllaç a l’entrada corresponent del Diccionari dels ocells del món, un projecte disponible en línia des de l’any 2017, que permet la consulta de més de 8.000 fitxes terminològiques corresponents a totes les espècies d’ocells no passeriformes i a les espècies de 85 famílies d’ocells passeriformes.\n\nEs tracta d’una obra en curs d’elaboració que s’amplia progressivament a mesura que avança el treball de validació de les denominacions catalanes de les espècies de la cinquantena de famílies d’ocells passeriformes actualment en curs de revisió.\n\nAquesta infografia interactiva, que es preveu ampliar més endavant amb la publicació d’una segona part que inclourà la resta de famílies de passeriformes, també es pot consultar o imprimir en format pòster.\n\nOcells passeriformes (1) s'afegeix al centenar de productes multimèdia que el TERMCAT ofereix amb la voluntat d'afavorir la difusió de la terminologia dels diferents àmbits d'especialitat, entre els quals cal destacar, en el camp de l’ornitologia: Ocells no passeriformes, L’anar i venir dels ocells: els ocells migradors, Ocells marins: un tresor en perill i Ocells amb nom de dona.Inicio: La Fundación para el Desarrollo Integrado Sustentable (FUDIS), es una organización creada en 1997, que se enfoca en propiciar bienestar social, económico y ambiental en la sociedad.Red fody - Wikipedia: The red fody (Foudia madagascariensis), also known as the Madagascar fody in Madagascar, red cardinal fody in Mauritius, or common fody, is a small bird native to Madagascar and introduced to various other islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a common bird within its restricted range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \"least concern\".\n\nIn 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red fody in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Madagascar. He used the French name Le cardinal de Madagascar and the Latin Cardinalis Madagascariensis.[2] Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.[3] When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson.[3] One of these was the red fody. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Loxia madagascariensis and cited Brisson's work.[4] This species is now placed in the genus Foudia that was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1850.[5] The type species was subsequently designated as the red fody.[6] The species is monotypic.[7]\n\nThe red fody is about 5 inches (13 cm) in length and weighs 14–19 grams (0.49–0.67 oz). The male of the species is bright red with black markings around each eye. Its wings and tail are brown. Its underparts are also red, which distinguishes it from other fodies in areas where it has been introduced. The female fody's upper parts are olive-brown and its underparts are greyish brown.[8]\n\nIt is a common bird found in forest clearings, grasslands and cultivated areas, but not in dense forest. In Madagascar it is regarded as a pest of rice cultivation. It has been introduced to other areas of the Indian Ocean, included the Amirantes, Comoros, Seychelles, Mauritius, Réunion and Saint Helena.[8]\n\nThe red fody feeds largely on seeds, especially grass seeds, and insects, but several other foodstuffs are also taken; these include fruit, nectar, household scraps and copra.[8]\n\nOutside the breeding season, this bird is gregarious. As the breeding season approaches, males establish territories, about 30 m (100 ft) in diameter. The birds are monogamous, and the male starts building the nest in the centre of the territory before courtship commences, with nests being clustered together in loose colonies. The nest is globular with a side entrance and porch or short tube. It is constructed, mostly by the male, out of rootlets, tendrils, grasses and other long strands of vegetation, woven together. The nest takes around eight days to build, and many get abandoned if the male fails to attract a mate.[8]\n\nIn different parts of its introduced range, this species show different impacts on native birds. Both the endangered Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra) and the Rodrigues fody (Foudia flavicans) have been affected by the competition for resources on their respective islands.[9]Mauritius Fody (Foudia rubra) | Summary | BirdLife International: Click here for more information about the Red List categories and criteriaThis species is classified as Endangered because it has an extremely small population. The population has been stable since the early 1990s but then increased following an island translocation, and if it remains stable or increasing with over 250 mature individuals it may warrant downlisting to Vulnerable in the future.Fody - Wikipedia: Fodies are small passerine birds belonging to the genus Foudia in the weaver family Ploceidae.\n\nThe birds are 12 to 15 centimetres (4.7 to 5.9 in) long and have short, conical bills. Males in breeding plumage are usually colourful with bright red or yellow on the head and sometimes elsewhere. Non-breeding males and females are dull, sparrow-like birds with mostly grey-brown plumage.\n\nFodies are typically found in forest, woodland or scrubland but some also occur in man-made habitats, especially the red fody. Some species feed mainly on seeds while others are largely insectivorous. Fodies build a dome-shaped nest of grass and other plant material. It has a side-opening and it is suspended from a branch or palm leaf.\n\nThe genus was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1850.[2] The type species was subsequently designated as the red fody.[3]\n\nThe genus contains eight species:[4]\n\nThey are native to the islands of the western Indian Ocean where they occur on Madagascar, the Seychelles, the Comoro Islands and the Mascarene Islands. The red fody has also been introduced to the Chagos Archipelago, Bahrain and Saint Helena. While the red fody is one of the most common birds of the region, several of the other fodies are considered to be threatened, particularly the Mauritius fody which is classed as endangered.Reunion Fody (Foudia delloni) | Summary | BirdLife International: This species was endemic to the island of Réunion, where it was once described as abundant. It was last seen shortly after 1672 and was likely driven to extinction following the arrival of rats on the island. It is therefore classified as Extinct.0 mature individualsnoRed Fody - eBird: Sparrow-like weaver in which scarlet breeding males are distinctive, but females and non-breeding females very drab. Found in virtually all habitats except the interior of thick forest. Often found in flocks, sometimes mixed with other birds. Calls are high, silvery notes, given in long series as a song. Can be very similar to Forest Fody. Breeding male Red Fody has red on the back and belly, though molting males can match the pattern of Forest Fody. Females and non-breeding males very similar, but Red Fody is paler and less greenish, with a smaller bill. Unlike Forest Fody, not found in the rainforest interior. Separated from female and non-breeding male Sakalava Weaver by smaller size, smaller bill, and different facial markings."}

Mantener refrigerado.\n\n* Imágenes referenciales sujeto a stock de decoración\n\n * Medidas referenciales y aproximadas sujetos a cambios imprevistosLes Misérables - Wikipedia: Les Misérables ( ,[4] French: [le mizeʁabl]) is a French epic historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published on 31 March 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century. Les Misérables has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film, television, and the stage, including a musical.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, the novel is usually referred to by its original French title. However, several alternatives have been used, including The Miserables, The Wretched, The Miserable Ones, The Poor Ones, The Wretched Poor, The Victims, and The Dispossessed.[5] Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption.[6]\n\nExamining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the history of France, the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love.\n\nUpton Sinclair described the novel as \"one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world\" and remarked that Hugo set forth the purpose of Les Misérables in the preface:[7]\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Hugo explains the work's overarching structure:[8]\n\nThe novel contains various subplots, but the main thread is the story of ex-convict Jean Valjean, who becomes a force for good in the world but cannot escape his criminal past. The novel is divided into 5 volumes, each divided into several books and subdivided into chapters, for a total of 48 books and 365 chapters. Each chapter is relatively short, commonly no longer than a few pages.\n\nThe novel as a whole is one of the longest ever written,[9] with 655,478 words in the original French. Hugo explained his ambitions for the novel to his Italian publisher:\n\nMore than a quarter of the novel—by one count 955 of 2,783 pages—is devoted to essays that argue a moral point or display Hugo's encyclopedic knowledge but do not advance the plot, nor even a subplot, a method Hugo used in such other works as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Toilers of the Sea. One biographer noted, \"The digressions of genius are easily pardoned\".[11] The topics Hugo addresses include cloistered religious orders, the construction of the Paris sewers, argot, and the street urchins of Paris. The one about convents he titles \"Parenthesis\" to alert the reader to its irrelevance to the storyline.[12]\n\nHugo devotes another 19 chapters (Volume II, Book I) to an account—and meditation on the place in history—of the Battle of Waterloo, the battlefield of which Hugo visited in 1861 and where he finished writing the novel. It opens volume 2 with such a change of subject as to seem the beginning of an entirely different work. The fact that this \"digression\" occupies such a large part of the text demands that it be read in the context of the \"overarching structure\" discussed above. Hugo draws his own personal conclusions, taking Waterloo to be a pivot point in history but definitely not a victory for the forces of reaction.\n\nOne critic has called this \"the spiritual gateway\" to the novel, as its chance encounter of Thénardier and Colonel Pontmercy foreshadows so many of the novel's encounters \"blending chance and necessity\", a \"confrontation of heroism and villainy\".\n\nEven when not turning to other subjects outside his narrative, Hugo sometimes interrupts the straightforward recitation of events, his voice and control of the storyline unconstrained by time and sequence. The novel opens with a statement about the bishop of Digne in 1815 and immediately shifts: \"Although these details in no way essentially concern that which we have to tell...\" Only after 14 chapters does Hugo pick up the opening thread again, \"In the early days of the month of October, 1815...\", to introduce Jean Valjean.[14]\n\nAn incident Hugo witnessed in 1829 involved three strangers and a police officer. One of the strangers was a man who had stolen a loaf of bread, similar to Jean Valjean, being taken to the coach by a police officer. Nearby, two onlookers, a mother and daughter, had stopped to watch the thief. They became the inspiration for Fantine and Cosette. Hugo imagined the life of the man in jail and the mother and daughter taken away from each other.[15]\n\nValjean's character is loosely based on the life of the ex-convict Eugène François Vidocq. Vidocq became the head of an undercover police unit and later founded France's first private detective agency. He was also a businessman and was widely noted for his social engagement and philanthropy. Vidocq also inspired Hugo's \"Claude Gueux\" and Le Dernier jour d'un condamné (The Last Day of a Condemned Man).[16]\n\nIn 1828, Vidocq, already pardoned, saved one of the workers in his paper factory by lifting a heavy cart on his shoulders as Valjean does.[17] Hugo's description of Valjean rescuing a sailor on the Orion draws almost word for word on a Baron La Roncière's letter describing such an incident.[18] Hugo used Bienvenu de Miollis (1753–1843), the Bishop of Digne during the time in which Valjean encounters Myriel, as the model for Myriel.[19]\n\nHugo had used the departure of prisoners from the Bagne of Toulon in one of his early stories, Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamné. He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845. On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: \"JEAN TRÉJEAN\". When the book was finally written, Tréjean became Valjean.[20]\n\nIn 1841, Hugo saved a prostitute from arrest for assault. He used a short part of his dialogue with the police when recounting Valjean's rescue of Fantine in the novel.[21] On 22 February 1846, when he had begun work on the novel, Hugo witnessed the arrest of a bread thief while a duchess and her child watched the scene pitilessly from their coach.[22] He spent several vacations in Montreuil-sur-Mer.\n\nDuring the 1832 revolt, Hugo walked the streets of Paris, saw the barricades blocking his way at points, and had to take shelter from gunfire.[25]: 173–174 He participated more directly in the 1848 Paris insurrection, helping to smash barricades and suppress both the popular revolt and its monarchist allies.[25]: 273–276\n\nVictor Hugo drew his inspiration from everything he heard and saw, writing it down in his diary. In December 1846, he witnessed an altercation between an old woman scavenging through rubbish and a street urchin who might have been Gavroche.[26] He also informed himself by personal inspection of the Paris Conciergerie in 1846 and Waterloo in 1861, by gathering information on some industries, and on working-class people's wages and living standards. He asked his mistresses, Léonie d'Aunet and Juliette Drouet, to tell him about life in convents. He also slipped personal anecdotes into the plot. For instance, Marius and Cosette's wedding night (Part V, Book 6, Chapter 1) takes place on 16 February 1833, which is also the date when Hugo and his lifelong mistress Juliette Drouet made love for the first time.[27]\n\nA template for Hugo's novel was Les Mystères de Paris (The Mysteries of Paris), a serial novel of similar length that enjoyed great success on its appearance in 1842–43, by Eugène Sue. Les mystères, like Les Misérables, views contemporary Paris from the point of view of the downtrodden and criminal underclasses who had been little represented in novels up to the time and features the interventions of detectives and the indifference of aristocrats. Although socially progressive in tone, it is more sensationalist than Les Misérables and does not have the same breadth of moral vision.\n\nIn 1815 Digne, the peasant Jean Valjean, just released from 19 years' imprisonment in the Bagne of Toulon—five for stealing bread for his starving sister and her family and fourteen more for numerous escape attempts—is turned away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.\n\nDigne's benevolent Bishop Myriel gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his soul has been purchased for God and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.\n\nValjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-sou coin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and panics, searching the city for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him because if he is apprehended, he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.\n\nSix years pass, and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector Javert, who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.\n\nYears earlier in Paris, a grisette named Fantine was very much in love with Félix Tholomyès. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle, were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomyès's daughter, Cosette. When Fantine arrives at Montfermeil, she leaves Cosette in the care of the Thénardiers, a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.\n\nFantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate, and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Thénardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth and resorts to prostitution to pay the Thénardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.\n\nA dandy named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists, but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.\n\nJavert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.\n\nAfter Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave.\n\nValjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in the Bagne of Toulon, Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.\n\nValjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Thénardiers abuse her while pampering their own daughters, Éponine and Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to give Cosette a present of an expensive new doll, which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. Éponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Thénardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behavior, caring only that he pays for his food and lodging.\n\nThe next morning, Valjean informs the Thénardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Thénardier immediately accepts while Thénardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Thénardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Thénardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Thénardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Thénardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Thénardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back towards home.\n\nValjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at the Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette, and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener, and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.\n\nEight years later, the Friends of the ABC, led by Enjolras, are preparing an act of anti-Orléanist civil unrest (i.e., the Paris uprising on 5–6 June 1832, a setting contrary to the popular notion that the book is set in the 1789 French Revolution)[28][29] following the death of Lamarque, a popular general known for his sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells. The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of the Cour des miracles, including the Thénardiers' eldest son, Gavroche, who is a street urchin.\n\nOne of the students, Marius Pontmercy, has become alienated from his family (especially his royalist grandfather, M. Gillenormand) because of his Bonapartist views. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Thénardier who saved his life at Waterloo—in reality, Thénardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant under Napoleon to avoid exposing himself as a robber.\n\nAt the Luxembourg Garden, Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Thénardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname Jondrette at the Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Thénardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Thénardiers.\n\nÉponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing \"The Cops Are Here\" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the \"Jondrettes\" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Thénardier had hoped).\n\nThe philanthropist and his daughter—actually Valjean and Cosette—enter. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises to return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks Éponine to retrieve her address for him. Éponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees. The Thénardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Thénardier enlists the aid of Patron-Minette, a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.\n\nMarius overhears Thénardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Thénardier sends Éponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Thénardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him, revealing his true identity. Marius recognizes Thénardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.\n\nHe tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Thénardier. Valjean denies knowing Thénardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Thénardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, saying they will keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Thénardier of his address, Thénardier sends out Mme. Thénardier to get Cosette. Mme. Thénardier comes back alone and announces the address is a fake.\n\nIt is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Thénardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that Éponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Thénardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Thénardier reads it and thinks Éponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Thénardier, and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.\n\nHe arrests all the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette (except Claquesous, who escapes during his transportation to prison, and Montparnasse, who stops to run off with Éponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.\n\nVolume IV: The Idyll in the Rue Plumet and the Epic in the Rue St. Denis\n\nAfter Éponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at \"the Field of the Lark\" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Thénardier, Patron-Minette, and Brujon manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean and Cosette's house. However, Éponine, who has been sitting by the gates, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week, which greatly troubles the pair.\n\nThe next day, Valjean is sitting in the Champ de Mars. He is feeling troubled about seeing Thénardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap. It says, \"Move Out.\" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes home, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme-Armé, and restates that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses to consent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.\n\nThe following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that he is a spy. When Enjolras confronts Javert about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius returns to Valjean and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet but finds it no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.\n\nWhen Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot him. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, and a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.\n\nMarius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for him earlier calls him by his name. Marius discovers this man is Éponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.\n\nThe author also tells the reader that Éponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. Éponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to having obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him but deciding to do so for fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, Éponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was \"a little bit in love\" with him, and dies.\n\nMarius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is from Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.\n\nValjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still uncertain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.\n\nValjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Thénardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Thénardier, but Thénardier doesn't recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Thénardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean's and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can determine his identity later. Thénardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer to distract the policeman who has been pursuing him.\n\nUpon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly, Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks for a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window, he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but cannot ignore his duty to the law either. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine.\n\nMarius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during Mardi Gras festivities, Valjean is spotted by Thénardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius's judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.\n\nThénardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Thénardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean by revealing all the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is a murderer and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Thénardier's face. He then confronts Thénardier about his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Thénardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America, where he becomes a slave trader.\n\nAs they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab in Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n• Jean Valjean (also known as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre) – The protagonist of the novel. He was born in Faverolles, Aisne. Convicted for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's seven starving children and sent to prison for five years, he is paroled from prison nineteen years later (after four unsuccessful escape attempts added twelve years and fighting back during the second escape attempt added two extra years). Rejected by society for being a former convict, he encounters Bishop Myriel, who turns his life around by showing him mercy and encouraging him to become a new man. While sitting and pondering what Bishop Myriel had said, he puts his shoe on a forty-sou piece dropped by a young wanderer. Valjean threatens the boy with his stick when the boy attempts to rouse him from his reverie and recover his money. He tells a passing priest his name and the name of the boy, which allows the police to charge him with armed robbery – a sentence that, if he were caught again, would return him to prison for life. He assumes a new identity (Monsieur Madeleine) in order to pursue an honest life. He introduces new manufacturing techniques and eventually builds two factories, becoming one of the richest men in the area. By popular acclaim, he is made mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. He confronts Javert over Fantine's punishment, turns himself in to the police to save another man from prison for life, and rescues Cosette from the Thénardiers. Discovered by Javert in Paris because of his generosity to the poor, he evades capture for the next several years in a convent. He saves Marius from imprisonment and probable death at the barricade, reveals his true identity to Marius and Cosette after their wedding, and is reunited with them just before his death, having kept his promise to the bishop and to Fantine, the image of whom is the last thing he sees before dying.\n• Javert – A fanatic police inspector in pursuit to recapture Valjean. Born in the prisons to a convict father and a fortune teller mother, he renounces both of them and starts working as a guard in the prison, including one stint as the overseer for the chain gang of which Valjean is part (and here witnesses firsthand Valjean's enormous strength and just what he looks like). Eventually, he joins the police force in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He arrests Fantine and comes into conflict with Valjean/Madeleine, who orders him to release Fantine. Valjean dismisses Javert in front of his squad, and Javert, seeking revenge, reports to the police inspector that he has discovered Jean Valjean. He is told that he must be incorrect, as a man mistakenly believed to be Jean Valjean was just arrested. He requests M. Madeleine to dismiss him in disgrace, for he cannot be less harsh on himself than on others. When the real Jean Valjean turns himself in, Javert is promoted to the Paris police force, where he arrests Valjean and sends him back to prison. After Valjean escapes again, Javert attempts one more arrest in vain. He almost recaptures Valjean at the Gorbeau House when he arrests the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette. Later, while working undercover behind the barricade, his identity is discovered. Valjean pretends to execute Javert but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral. After composing a letter to the prefect of police outlining the squalid conditions that occur in prisons and the abuses that prisoners are subjected to, he takes his own life by jumping into the Seine.\n• Fantine – She was born in Montreuil-sur-Mer but moved to Paris as a teenager. This grisette was abandoned with a small child by her lover, Félix Tholomyès. Fantine leaves her daughter, Cosette, in the care of the Thénardiers, innkeepers in the village of Montfermeil. Mme. Thénardier spoils her own daughters and abuses Cosette. Fantine finds work at Monsieur Madeleine's factory. Illiterate, she has others write letters to the Thénardiers on her behalf. A female supervisor discovers that she is an unwed mother and dismisses her. To meet the Thénardiers' repeated demands for money, she sells her hair and two front teeth and turns to prostitution. She becomes ill. Valjean learns of her plight when Javert arrests her for attacking a man who called her insulting names and threw snow down her back. He sends her to a hospital. Because her illness has made her so weak, she dies of shock when Javert, confronting Valjean in her hospital room, reveals that Valjean is a convict and has not brought Cosette to her (after the doctor encouraged the incorrect belief that Jean Valjean's recent absence was because he was bringing her daughter to her).\n• Cosette (formally Euphrasie, also known as \"the Lark\", Mademoiselle Lanoire, Ursula) – The illegitimate daughter of Fantine and Tholomyès. From approximately the age of three to the age of eight, she is beaten and forced to work as a drudge for the Thénardiers. After her mother dies, Valjean ransoms her from the Thénardiers and cares for her as if she were his daughter. Nuns in a Paris convent educate her. She grows up to become very beautiful. She falls in love with Marius Pontmercy and marries him near the novel's conclusion.\n• Marius Pontmercy – A young law student loosely associated with the Friends of the ABC. He shares the political principles of his father and has a tempestuous relationship with his royalist grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand. He falls in love with Cosette and fights on the barricades when he believes Valjean has taken her to London. After he and Cosette marry, he recognizes Thénardier as a swindler and pays him to leave France.\n• Éponine (the Jondrette girl) – The Thénardiers' elder daughter. As a child, she is pampered and spoiled by her parents but ends up a street urchin when she reaches adolescence. She participates in her father's crimes and begging schemes to obtain money. She is blindly in love with Marius. At Marius's request, she finds Valjean and Cosette's house for him and sadly leads him there. She also prevents her father, Patron-Minette, and Brujon from robbing the house during one of Marius's visits there to see Cosette. After disguising herself as a boy, she manipulates Marius into going to the barricades, hoping she and Marius will die there together. Wanting to die before him, however, she reaches out her hand to stop a soldier from shooting at him; she is mortally wounded as the bullet goes through her hand and her back. As she is dying, she confesses all this to Marius and gives him a letter from Cosette. Her final request to Marius is that once she has passed, he will kiss her on the forehead. He fulfills her request not because of romantic feelings on his part, but out of pity for her hard life.\n• Monsieur Thénardier and Madame Thénardier (also known as the Jondrettes, M. Fabantou, M. Thénard. Some translations identify her as the Thenardiess) – Husband and wife, parents of five children: two daughters, Éponine and Azelma, and three sons, Gavroche and two unnamed younger sons. As innkeepers, they abuse Cosette as a child and extort payment from Fantine for her support, until Valjean takes Cosette away. They become bankrupt and relocate under the name Jondrette to a house in Paris called the Gorbeau House, living in the room next to Marius. The husband associates with a criminal group called Patron-Minette and conspires to rob Valjean until he is thwarted by Marius. Javert arrests the couple. The wife dies in prison. Her husband attempts to blackmail Marius with his knowledge of Valjean's past, but Marius pays him to leave the country and he becomes a slave trader in the United States.\n• Gavroche – The unloved middle child and eldest son of the Thénardiers.

The narrator occasionally injects himself into the narrative or reports facts outside the time of the narrative to emphasize that he is recounting historical events, not entirely fiction. He introduces his recounting of Waterloo with several paragraphs describing the narrator's recent approach to the battlefield: \"Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles ...\" The narrator describes how \"[a]n observer, a dreamer, the author of this book\" during the 1832 street fighting was caught in the crossfire: \"All that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour.\" At one point, he apologizes for intruding—\"The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself\"—to ask the reader's understanding when he describes \"the Paris of his youth ... as though it still existed\". This introduces a meditation on memories of past places that his contemporary readers would recognize as a self-portrait written from exile: \"You have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.\" He describes another occasion when a bullet shot \"pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended ... over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of the market.\" As evidence of police double agents at the barricades, he writes, \"The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.\"\n\nThe appearance of the novel was a highly anticipated event, as Victor Hugo was considered one of France's foremost poets in the middle of the nineteenth century. The New York Times announced its forthcoming publication as early as April 1860.[31] Hugo forbade his publishers from summarizing his story and refused to authorize the publication of excerpts in advance of publication. He instructed them to build on his earlier success and suggested this approach: \"What Victor H. did for the Gothic world in Notre-Dame of Paris [The Hunchback of Notre-Dame], he accomplishes for the modern world in Les Misérables\". A massive advertising campaign[33] preceded the release of the first two volumes of Les Misérables in Brussels on 30 or 31 March and in Paris on 3 April 1862.[34] The remaining volumes appeared on 15 May 1862.\n\nCritical reactions were wide-ranging and often negative. Some critics found the subject matter immoral, others complained of its excessive sentimentality, and others were disquieted by its apparent sympathy with the revolutionaries. L. Gauthier wrote in Le Monde on 17 August 1862, \"One cannot read without an unconquerable disgust all the details Monsieur Hugo gives regarding the successful planning of riots.\"[35] The Goncourt brothers judged the novel artificial and disappointing.[36] Flaubert found \"neither truth nor greatness\" in it. He complained that the characters were crude stereotypes who all \"speak very well – but all in the same way\". He deemed it an \"infantile\" effort and brought an end to Hugo's career like \"the fall of a god\".[37] In a newspaper review, Charles Baudelaire praised Hugo's success in focusing public attention on social problems, though he believed that such propaganda was the opposite of art. In private, he castigated it as \"repulsive and inept\" (immonde et inepte).[38][39]\n\nThe work was a commercial success and has been a popular book ever since it was published.[40][41] Translated the same year it appeared into several foreign languages, including Italian, Greek, and Portuguese, it proved popular not only in France but across Europe and abroad.\n• Charles E.

The author aspired to \"write a work which departed from the ordinary, which made a noise, and which would remain on earth after his death\".\n\nAs an epistolary novel, the book is composed of letters written by the various characters to each other. In particular, the letters between Valmont and the Marquise make up the majority of the plot, along with those of Cécile de Volanges and Madame de Tourvel.\n\nIt has been adapted multiple times, including the successful 1985 play and subsequent award-winning 1988 film adaptation.\n\nThe Marquise de Merteuil is determined to corrupt the young Cécile de Volanges, whose mother has only recently brought her out of a convent to be married to Merteuil's previous lover, who has discarded her rudely. At the same time the notorious Vicomte de Valmont is determined to seduce the virtuous, married, and therefore inaccessible Madame de Tourvel, who is staying with his aunt while her husband is away on a court case. Cécile falls in love with the Chevalier Danceny (her young music tutor), and Merteuil and Valmont pretend to help the secret lovers in order to gain their trust and manipulate them later to benefit their own schemes.\n\nMerteuil first suggests that the Vicomte should seduce Cécile in order to enact her revenge on Cécile's future husband but Valmont refuses, finding the challenge too easy and preferring to devote himself to seducing Madame de Tourvel. He is however interested in resuming their affair. Merteuil promises Valmont that if he seduces Madame de Tourvel and provides her with written proof of seduction, she will spend the night with him.\n\nValmont befriends Tourvel by convincing her that he has changed his rakish ways and become a virtuous man, but he finds seducing her to be a far greater challenge than his previous conquests.\n\nValmont is infuriated on discovering that Cécile's mother has written to Madame de Tourvel to warn her about his bad character. He avenges himself by seducing Cécile as Merteuil had suggested. Meanwhile, Merteuil takes Danceny as her lover.\n\nBy the time Valmont has succeeded in seducing Madame de Tourvel, he seems to have fallen in love with her. Jealous, Merteuil tricks him into deserting Madame de Tourvel, and reneges on her promise of spending the night with him. In retaliation, Valmont reveals that he prompted Danceny to reunite with Cécile, leaving Merteuil abandoned yet again. Merteuil declares war on Valmont and reveals to Danceny that Valmont has seduced Cécile.\n\nDanceny and Valmont duel, and Valmont is fatally wounded. Before he dies, he gives Danceny the letters proving Merteuil's own involvement. These letters are sufficient to ruin her reputation, and she flees to the countryside, after contracting smallpox. Her face is left permanently scarred and she is rendered blind in one eye. She loses her greatest asset, her beauty, as well as her reputation and much of her fortune. Desperate with guilt and grief, Madame de Tourvel succumbs to a fever and dies, while Cécile returns to the convent, dishonoured.\n\nLes Liaisons dangereuses is celebrated for its exploration of seduction, revenge and malice, presented in the form of fictional letters collected and published by a fictional author. The book was viewed as scandalous at the time of its publication, though the real intentions of the author remain unknown. It has been suggested that Laclos's intention was the same as that of his fictional author in the novel; to write a morality tale about the French nobility of the Ancien Régime. The theory has been questioned on several grounds; Laclos enjoyed the patronage of France's most senior aristocrat—Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. All the characters in the story are aristocrats, including the virtuous ones like Madame de Tourvel and Madame de Rosemonde and many royalist and conservative figures enjoyed the book, including Queen Marie Antoinette, which suggests that—despite its scandalous reputation—it was not viewed as a political work until the French Revolution made it appear as such, with the benefit of hindsight.\n\nWayland Young notes that most critics have viewed the work as\n\nIn a well-known essay on Les Liaisons dangereuses, which has often been used as a preface to French editions of the novel, André Malraux argues that, despite its debt to the libertine tradition, Les Liaisons dangereuses is more significant as the introduction of a new kind of character in French fiction. Malraux writes that the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont are creations \"without precedent\"; they are \"the first [in European literature] whose acts are determined by an ideology\".[2]\n\nLes Liaisons dangereuses is a literary counter-thesis to the epistolary novel as exemplified by Richardson's Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded. Whereas Richardson uses the technique of letters to provide the reader with a feeling of knowing the protagonist's true and intimate thoughts, Laclos' use of this literary device is the opposite: by presenting the reader with grossly conflicting views from the same writer when addressing different recipients, it is left to the reader to reconcile story, intentions and characters behind the letters. The use of duplicitous characters with one virtuous face can be viewed as a complex criticism of the immensely popular naïve moral epistolary novel.\n\nThe novel has been adapted into various media, under many different names.\n• German playwright Heiner Müller adapted the story in 1981, entitling it Quartet.\n• Christopher Hampton's 1985 adaptation, Les liaisons dangereuses, opened in London's West End and in 1987 crossed over to Broadway with Alan Rickman originating the role of the Vicomte de Valmont, Lindsay Duncan as Marquise de Merteuil, and Juliet Stevenson as Madame de Tourvel. In 2012 the Sydney Theatre Company staged Hampton's adaptation with Hugo Weaving as the Vicomte, and Pamela Rabe as the Marquise.\n• In 2012, John Malkovich directed a version of the play with Paris' Théâtre de l'Atelier.\n• Las Relaciones Peligrosas, a musical adaptation penned by Marcelo Caballero (book and lyrics) and Steban Ghorghor (music), had a world premiere in 2012 at El Cubo Theatre, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n• In 2015, Josie Rourke directed a revival of the Christopher Hampton version at the Donmar Warehouse in London with Dominic West as the Vicomte and Janet McTeer as the Marquise.

Wikipedia: The Leftovers is an American supernatural drama television series created by Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta that aired on HBO from June 29, 2014, to June 4, 2017.[1] Based on Perrotta's 2011 novel,[2] the series begins three years after the \"Sudden Departure\", a global event that resulted in 2% of the world's population disappearing. The lives of police chief Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) and his family, along with grieving widow Nora Durst (Carrie Coon) and her brother, Reverend Matt Jamison (Christopher Eccleston), are the focal points of the series as they struggle to adjust to life after the Departure.\n\nThe pilot was written by Lindelof and Perrotta and directed by Peter Berg.[3] The series stars an ensemble cast led by Theroux and features Amy Brenneman, Christopher Eccleston, Liv Tyler, Chris Zylka, Margaret Qualley, Carrie Coon, Ann Dowd, Regina King, Jovan Adepo, Kevin Carroll, Janel Moloney, and Scott Glenn. The series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on October 4, 2015, and concluded December 6, 2015.[4] On December 10, 2015, at Lindelof's request to be able to conclude the series, HBO renewed it for a third and final season,[6] which premiered on April 16, 2017, and concluded on June 4, 2017.[7] Over the course of the series, 28 episodes aired over three seasons.\n\nThe first season received mostly positive reviews, though some criticized the series for its grim tone.[8] The series underwent a critical reevaluation during its acclaimed second and third seasons,[9][10] with many critics referring to The Leftovers as one of the greatest television series of all time,[11][12][13][14][15] with particular praise for its writing, directing, acting (particularly Theroux's and Coon's) and thematic depth.[8][9][10] The musical score composed by Max Richter also attracted critical praise.[16] Despite receiving average Nielsen ratings throughout its run, the series has developed a cult following.[17][18] The series has been compared favorably to Lost, a previous series co-created by Lindelof.[19][20][21][22]\n\nThe Leftovers starts three years after a global event called the \"Sudden Departure\", the inexplicable, simultaneous disappearance of 140 million people, 2% of the world's population, on October 14, 2011.[23] Following that event, mainstream religions declined, and a number of cults emerged, most notably the Guilty Remnant, a group of white-clothed, chain-smoking nihilists, and a cult led by Holy Wayne, a man who views himself as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[24]\n\nThe first season revolves around the Garvey family and their acquaintances in a fictionalized version of the town of Mapleton, New York. Kevin Garvey Jr. is the chief of police. His wife, Laurie, has joined the Guilty Remnant. Their son, Tommy, has left home to become a follower of Holy Wayne, and their daughter, Jill, is acting out.[2] Meanwhile, grieving widow Nora Durst and her brother, Reverend Matt Jamison, struggle to deal with their respective traumas while adjusting to life post-Departure. It also follows Meg Abbott, a woman who is slowly seduced by the Mapleton faction of the Guilty Remnant, led by Patti Levin. These characters' lives intertwine and collide as they find themselves in the middle of an ongoing conflict between the Guilty Remnant and the townspeople of Mapleton.\n\nIn the second season, the location shifts from Mapleton to the fictional town of Jarden, Texas, where not a single citizen was lost in the Sudden Departure. The Murphy family becomes a key focal point of the season. The patriarch, John, is the chief firefighter of the town, also acting as a vigilante deterrent of people exploiting Jarden's \"miracle\". His wife, Erika, is a doctor. Their son, Michael, is an aspiring pastor and their daughter, Evie, is a high school student with epilepsy. The Garvey family, Nora, and Matt move to Jarden at a time which coincides with an incident that leads to the disappearance of three young girls, followed by mass panic and chaos that threatens the town's safety and forces the Garvey and Murphy families to confront their inner demons.\n\nThe third and final season unfolds three years later, in 2018, starting 14 days before the seventh anniversary of the Sudden Departure.

He served as the series' showrunner.[2]\n\nIn February 2013, HBO ordered a pilot and, in September, ordered a 10-episode first season.[29][30] The Leftovers is the first series HBO acquired from an outside studio that it did not produce in-house.[31]\n\nThe first season covers the entirety of the book; the second and third seasons are completely original material.[32][33] In April 2015, it was reported that the setting for the second season would shift from Mapleton, New York to a small town in Texas.[34] The series shifted filming locations from New York to Austin, Texas, with nearby Lockhart serving as the main street of fictional Jarden, Texas, when principal photography commenced in late April.[35][36] For the second season, which features several changes, including cast, location, and storylines; Lindelof cited The Wire and Friday Night Lights as influences.[37][38]\n\nThe final season began principal photography in early May 2016, in Austin.[33] In June 2016, the production moved to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, where it filmed the remainder of the series and completed post-production. On the move to Melbourne, Lindelof said, \"We're immensely grateful for the opportunity to try something that looks and feels different from the preceding seasons and we absolutely cannot wait to bring our story to its conclusion down under.\"[39][40] It was also confirmed that the season would have a shortened 8-episode run.[41]\n\nIn June 2013, casting announcements began. Justin Theroux, Liv Tyler, Christopher Eccleston, Ann Dowd, Amanda Warren, Michael Gaston, and Carrie Coon were announced to star in the pilot.[42][43][44]\n\nFor the second season, eight of the 14 main cast members from season one returned, while Emily Meade, Amanda Warren, Annie Q., Max Carver, Charlie Carver and Michael Gaston did not.[45] In April 2015, casting began for a family comprising ex-convict John Murphy; his hearing-impaired doctor wife, Erika; and their teenage children Evie, an outgoing athlete, and Michael, a pious Christian.[34] The roles of John, Erika, and Michael are portrayed by Kevin Carroll, Regina King and Jovan Adepo, respectively, all as series regulars.[46][47] Darius McCrary was cast in a recurring role as Isaac Rayney, John's friend and a palm reader.[47] Steven Williams was cast in a recurring role, playing Virgil, a confidant of Kevin's.[48] Janel Moloney, who had a recurring role in the first season as Mary Jamison, was promoted to a regular cast member in season two.\n\nFor the third season, it was confirmed in May 2016 that the entire main cast from the second season would return, with the exception of Dowd, and that Scott Glenn and Jasmin Savoy Brown had been promoted to series regulars.[41] Glenn is credited as part of the main cast for the five season 3 episodes in which he appears; Brown ultimately remained as a recurring guest star, appearing in three episodes of the season. Lindsay Duncan joined the cast on December 6, 2016, also as a recurring guest star.[49] Duncan appears in five episodes of the season.\n\nSeveral cast members did not continue in a regular capacity during season 3, but retain main cast credit for the episodes in which they feature. Liv Tyler appears in one scene in the first episode, and returns for one subsequent appearance in episode 7. Ann Dowd also returns to the main cast in episode 7 only. Margaret Qualley appears in the season's first episode only, with one subsequent voice cameo. Regina King appears in episode 2 only, and Janel Moloney features in two episodes. Chris Zylka appears for the final time in episode 2, making only one subsequent voice cameo, but retains his credit as a main cast member for the entire season. Additionally, season 1 main cast members Michael Gaston and Annie Q. return as guest stars.\n\nThe main title from the first season uses \"The Leftovers (Main Title Theme)\", an original piece of music by composer Max Richter, accompanied by images like a fresco in the style of the Sistine Chapel. The second season uses \"Let the Mystery Be\" by Iris DeMent. In addition, the opening changes to one that shows images of pictures and people who were departed missing from them and in their place is various images of earth-related phenomena like rain, clouds, aurora borealis and lightning. Season 3 retains the opening from Season 2 but with a different theme song for each episode, including reprises of the Season 1 main title theme and \"Let the Mystery Be\" in episodes seven and eight respectively. This is because Damon Lindelof wants to \"thematically introduce the episode to come\" with different title music for each episode.\n• \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now\" (theme from Perfect Strangers) by David Pomeranz\n• \"This Love Is Over\" by Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs\n• \"Let the Mystery Be\" by Iris DeMent\n\nThe first season of The Leftovers received mostly positive reviews from critics. Metacritic scored season one 65 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[50] Rotten Tomatoes scored the season 82%, based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 7.65/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Its dour tone and self-seriousness may make for somber viewing, but The Leftovers is an artfully crafted, thought-provoking drama that aims high and often hits its mark.\"[8] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave consistently high scores to all the season one episodes, including two perfect 10 scores for \"Two Boats and a Helicopter\" and the season finale \"The Prodigal Son Returns.\"[51] He then gave the entire first season a review score of 9.4 out of 10, particularly praising the character-centric episodes, Max Richter's score and the performances, particularly Carrie Coon's.[52]\n\nThe second season received critical acclaim. On Metacritic, it has a score of 80 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[53] Rotten Tomatoes gave the second season a rating of 94% with an average score of 8.8/10 based on 164 critic reviews, with the critical consensus \"The Leftovers continues to be unpredictable and provocative in season two with its new location, though the inexplicable circumstances will still frustrate many viewers.\"[9] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave it an \"A\" grade and wrote that \"The Leftovers is still TV's best drama as season 2 begins\"; it has \"tighter focus, but same powerful, immersive experience\".[54] In her five out of five star review, Emily St. James of Vox wrote: \"It's a show that wants to provoke a reaction in you, whether it's admiration, hatred, or just bafflement. It's HBO's best drama—and thus must-see TV.\"[55]\n\nThe third and final season received unanimous acclaim from critics. On Metacritic, it has a score of 98 out of 100 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[56] On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 99% rating with an average score of 9.35/10 based on 189 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With reliably ambitious storytelling and outstanding performances from its cast, Season 3 of The Leftovers approaches the series' conclusion as thoughtfully, purposefully, and confidently as it began.\"[10] Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote the final season \"is spectacular, in every sense of that word.\"[57] The Leftovers was ranked as the best TV series of 2017 according to Metacritic.[58] Alan Sepinwall placed season three first on his list of the best TV shows of 2017, an accolade he had awarded to both previous seasons in their respective years. He said \"this has been my show of the year — of the decade, maybe, depending on how we count things like Mad Men and Breaking Bad that debuted in the '00s\"; he went on to say \"the eight-episode final season was a miracle\".[59]\n\nAccording to Metacritic's aggregate of critics' decade-end lists, The Leftovers was the fifth-highest ranked show of the 2010s.[60]\n\nThe first season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in region 1 on October 6, 2015. The set contains two audio commentaries and four behind-the-scenes featurettes.[84] The second season was released on Blu-ray and DVD on February 9, 2016.[85] The third season's DVD format was released on October 10, 2017, while the Blu-ray format was released by the Warner Archive Collection.[86]The Leftovers (TV Series 2014–2017) ⭐ 8.3 | Drama, Fantasy, Mystery: Love everything about The Leftovers the writing, soundtrack, acting, and the goosebumps vibe I get from it is sensational!

Accédez à notre formulaire de contact et nous vous répondrons dans les plus brefs délais.Alexandrine Le Normant d'Étiolles - Wikipedia: Alexandrine-Jeanne Le Normant d’Étiolles (10 August 1744 – 15 June 1754) was the daughter of Madame de Pompadour, the maîtresse-en-titre of King Louis XV of France. She died in childhood.\n\nAlexandrine-Jeanne Le Normant d’Étiolles was born on 10 August 1744 to Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d’Étiolles and his wife Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson. She was named after her mother’s friend, author and salon host Claudine-Alexandrine Guérin de Tencin. It is possible that her parents were first cousins, as her mother’s biological father may have been Charles-François Paul Le Normant de Tournehem (who became Madame d’Étiolles’ guardian when her legal father, her mother’s husband, went into exile). Alexandrine had one sibling, an older brother named Charles-Guillaume-Louis (born December 1741, died before December 1742) who had already died by the time she was born.\n\nAlexandrine’s mother aimed to become the maîtresse-en-titre of King Louis XV. She achieved this by March 1745. However, to be introduced at court, she needed a noble title. The King and Madame d’Étiolles decided that she should separate from her husband, and the proceedings were initiated by 9 May. Madame d’Étiolles requested custody of her nine-month-old daughter. She was then made marquise of Pompadour and began to be known as Madame de Pompadour. Monsieur d’Étiolles was devastated and angered, threatening suicide, but soon accepted the situation. He started a new family with his mistress in 1754.[4]\n\nAlexandrine had been sent to a village wet nurse where her mother visited her often and brought her to Versailles more and more as she matured. After being weaned, she continued to be raised by a nurse and other domestic staff, but regularly spent time in her mother’s apartments or visited her maternal grandfather, François Poisson, who loved her affectionately. She grew up in a warm environment provided by her mother, maternal grandfather, and maternal uncle, Abel-François Poisson de Vandières, Marquis of Marigny and Menars.\n\nShe was known as ‘Madame Alexandrine’, following the form of addressing the filles de France, but her family nicknamed her ‘Fanfan’. She was described as ‘very thin’ but healthy.[8] Her education was supervised by the novelist Claud Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon, her mother’s friend and former teacher. At the age of six, Alexandrine was placed at the Convent of the Assumption in the rue Saint-Honoré in Paris, where many daughters of the aristocracy were raised, in order to prepare her for a career at court. Before entering, she spent a week with her mother in Marly-le-Roi. Madame de Pompadour was worried to leave her child in Paris but considered convent schooling important for her later success. She continued to spend time with her as often as possible.\n\nHer mother started arranging for Alexandrine a marriage that could integrate their family into the aristocracy. Pompadour’s first proposal was an illegitimate son of the King, Charles de Vintimille, Count of Luc. He was three years older than Alexandrine and the two occasionally played together. However, Louis XV did not agree to the plan. Pompadour then negotiated with Antoine de Vignerot du Plessis, Duke of Richelieu about a union between Alexandrine and the Duke’s son and heir, Armand-Emmanuel, Count of Chinon. Richelieu refused the idea, saying that as his wife was related to the House of Lorraine, the match would need to be approved by the Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I of Lorraine. He argued that the imperial court (headed by Empress Maria Theresa) would never agree to one of the Emperor’s relatives marrying a girl of middle-class origins, although this was probably an excuse for her own unwillingness. Although Pompadour could hope for an advantageous marriage for her daughter, the highest-ranking families did not want to be related to her. In the summer of 1752, she agreed with her close friend, Michel-Ferdinand d’Albert d’Ailly, Duke of Chaulnes, that Alexandrine would marry his only child, Louis-Joseph d’Albert d’Ailly, Duke of Picquigny.[14] They decided that the wedding would take place when Alexandrine was thirteen. It was also rumoured that her uncle Marigny wanted to marry Alexandrine himself.\n\nOn 14 June 1754, Alexandrine (still living at the convent) became ill with a high fever and convulsions. It was initially thought that she had indigestion. The nuns informed her parents; most biographies state that her father rushed to her, although Margaret Crosland clams there is no proof of this. Pevitt says that Pompadour was at the Château de Choisy with the King and could not leave to see her daughter,[4] while Crosland claims that she was not at court and could not be reached in time. Whatever the reason, she could not be with Alexandrine on her last day. Louis XV sent his own physicians, Jean-Baptiste Sénac and Germain Pichault de La Martinière [fr] but Alexandrine had died by the time they arrived. She died on 15 June 1754, less than two months before her tenth birthday, probably of peritonitis or appendicitis.\n\nPompadour was so stricken by grief when she was informed of her child’s death that onlookers feared she would collapse and die herself. She left court to spend a week in her Château de Bellevue, being ‘very afflicted and unwell’. Six weeks later, a contemporary reported that she acted happy, not displaying her grief over her daughter’s death, as that would have ‘done harm to her looks’ and endangered her position as maîtresse-en-titre. Privately, she remained ‘deeply shaken’. The contemporary noted that this behaviour was regular for courtiers.[4] Her grandfather, François Poisson, who had already been ill, died four or ten days after Alexandrine, devastated by her death. Pompadour never recovered from Alexandrine’s death,[4] which made her feel hopeless about the future.\n\nAlexandrine was buried in the Convent of the Assumption. Four months after her death, her body was transferred to the Capuchin Covent in Paris, where her mother had purchased a vault for the family. Her grave was inscribed, ‘Here lies Alexandrine-Jeanne, daughter of Messire Charles-Guillaume Le Normant and Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, Marquise de Pompadour, Dame de Crécy, etc’. Pompadour often visited the grave to pray. The remains of her maternal grandmother, Madeleine de La Motte, were also taken there, and Pompadour herself would later be interred there. The vault was damaged during the Revolution and the surrounding buildings rebuilt, inhibiting access to the tomb which, as of 2024, is under the rue de la Paix in Paris.2007 - Wikipedia: It has since been lost at the Battle of the Kodori ValleyNCBI - WWW Error Blocked Diagnostic: Your access to the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov has been temporarily blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving your site.

They are great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence. Humans have large brains, enabling more advanced cognitive skills that enable them to thrive and adapt in varied environments, develop highly complex tools, and form complex social structures and civilizations. Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of distinct social groups – from families and peer groups to corporations and political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society. Humans are also highly curious: the desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine. As of April 2024, there are estimated to be more than 8 billion humans alive.\n\nFor most of their history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the development of civilization and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid technological change. Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of sociocultural and technological developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle.\n\nAlthough some scientists equate the term \"humans\" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. All other members of the genus Homo, which are now extinct, are known as archaic humans, and the term \"modern human\" is used to distinguish Homo sapiens from archaic humans. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species. Migrating out of Africa, they gradually replaced and interbred with local populations of archaic humans. Multiple hypotheses for the extinction of archaic human species such as Neanderthals include competition, violence, interbreeding with Homo sapiens, or inability to adapt to climate change. Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), humans are among the least genetically diverse primates. Any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.\n\nHumans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment. They are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.[1] Human population growth, industrialization, land development, overconsumption and combustion of fossil fuels have led to environmental destruction and pollution that significantly contributes to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life.[2][3] Within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space.[4] Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions.[4] Humans have visited the Moon and made their presence known on other celestial bodies through human-made robotic spacecraft.[5][6][7] Since the early 20th century, there has been continuous human presence in Antarctica through research stations and, since 2000, in space through habitation on the International Space Station.[8] Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.\n\nAll modern humans are classified into the species Homo sapiens, coined by Carl Linnaeus in his 1735 work Systema Naturae.[9] The generic name Homo is a learned 18th-century derivation from Latin homō, which refers to humans of either sex.[10][11] The word human can refer to all members of the Homo genus.[12] The name Homo sapiens means 'wise man' or 'knowledgeable man'.[13] There is disagreement if certain extinct members of the genus, namely Neanderthals, should be included as a separate species of humans or as a subspecies of H. sapiens.[12]\n\nHuman is a loanword of Middle English from Old French humain, ultimately from Latin hūmānus, the adjectival form of homō ('man' – in the sense of humanity).[14] The native English term man can refer to the species generally (a synonym for humanity) as well as to human males. It may also refer to individuals of either sex.[15]\n\nDespite the fact that the word animal is colloquially used as an antonym for human,[16] and contrary to a common biological misconception, humans are animals.[17] The word person is often used interchangeably with human, but philosophical debate exists as to whether personhood applies to all humans or all sentient beings, and further if a human can lose personhood (such as by going into a persistent vegetative state).[18]\n\nHumans are apes (superfamily Hominoidea).[19] The lineage of apes that eventually gave rise to humans first split from gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and orangutans (genus Pongo), then gorillas (genus Gorilla), and finally, chimpanzees and bonobos (genus Pan). The last split, between the human and chimpanzee–bonobo lineages, took place around 8–4 million years ago, in the late Miocene epoch.[20][21] During this split, chromosome 2 was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes.[22] Following their split with chimpanzees and bonobos, the hominins diversified into many species and at least two distinct genera. All but one of these lineages – representing the genus Homo and its sole extant species Homo sapiens – are now extinct.[23]\n\nThe genus Homo evolved from Australopithecus.[24][25] Though fossils from the transition are scarce, the earliest members of Homo share several key traits with Australopithecus.[26][27] The earliest record of Homo is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen LD 350-1 from Ethiopia, and the earliest named species are Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis which evolved by 2.3 million years ago.[27] H. erectus (the African variant is sometimes called H. ergaster) evolved 2 million years ago and was the first archaic human species to leave Africa and disperse across Eurasia.[28] H. erectus also was the first to evolve a characteristically human body plan. Homo sapiens emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago from a species commonly designated as either H. heidelbergensis or H. rhodesiensis, the descendants of H. erectus that remained in Africa.[29] H. sapiens migrated out of the continent, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans.[30][31][32] Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–70,000 years ago,[33] and possibly earlier.[34] This development was likely selected amidst natural climate change in Middle to Late Pleistocene Africa.[35]\n\nThe \"out of Africa\" migration took place in at least two waves, the first around 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, the second (Southern Dispersal) around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago.[36][37] H. sapiens proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Eurasia 125,000 years ago,[38][39] Australia around 65,000 years ago,[40] the Americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand in the years 300 to 1280 CE.[41][42]\n\nHuman evolution was not a simple linear or branched progression but involved interbreeding between related species.[43][44][45] Genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages was common in human evolution.[46] DNA evidence suggests that several genes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non sub-Saharan-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day non sub-Saharan-African humans.[43][47][48]\n\nHuman evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes that have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The most significant of these adaptations are hairlessness,[49] obligate bipedalism, increased brain size and decreased sexual dimorphism (neoteny). The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.[50]\n\nUntil about 12,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers.[51][52] The Neolithic Revolution (the invention of agriculture) first took place in Southwest Asia and spread through large parts of the Old World over the following millennia.[53] It also occurred independently in Mesoamerica (about 6,000 years ago),[54] China,[55][56] Papua New Guinea,[57] and the Sahel and West Savanna regions of Africa.[58][59][60]\n\nAccess to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication of animals and the use of metal tools for the first time in history. Agriculture and sedentary lifestyle led to the emergence of early civilizations.[61][62][63]\n\nAn urban revolution took place in the 4th millennium BCE with the development of city-states, particularly Sumerian cities located in Mesopotamia.[64] It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, cuneiform script, appeared around 3000 BCE.[65] Other major civilizations to develop around this time were Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley Civilisation.[66] They eventually traded with each other and invented technology such as wheels, plows and sails.[67][68][69][70] Emerging by 3000 BCE, the Caral–Supe civilization is the oldest complex civilization in the Americas.[71] Astronomy and mathematics were also developed and the Great Pyramid of Giza was built.[72][73][74] There is evidence of a severe drought lasting about a hundred years that may have caused the decline of these civilizations,[75] with new ones appearing in the aftermath. Babylonians came to dominate Mesopotamia while others,[76] such as the Poverty Point culture, Minoans and the Shang dynasty, rose to prominence in new areas.[77][78][79] The Late Bronze Age collapse around 1200 BCE resulted in the disappearance of a number of civilizations and the beginning of the Greek Dark Ages.[80][81] During this period iron started replacing bronze, leading to the Iron Age.[82]\n\nIn the 5th century BCE, history started being recorded as a discipline, which provided a much clearer picture of life at the time.[83] Between the 8th and 6th century BCE, Europe entered the classical antiquity age, a period when ancient Greece and ancient Rome flourished.[84][85] Around this time other civilizations also came to prominence. The Maya civilization started to build cities and create complex calendars.[86][87] In Africa, the Kingdom of Aksum overtook the declining Kingdom of Kush and facilitated trade between India and the Mediterranean.[88] In West Asia, the Achaemenid Empire's system of centralized governance became the precursor to many later empires,[89] while the Gupta Empire in India and the Han dynasty in China have been described as golden ages in their respective regions.[90][91]\n\nFollowing the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Europe entered the Middle Ages.[92] During this period, Christianity and the Church would provide centralized authority and education.[93] In the Middle East, Islam became the prominent religion and expanded into North Africa. It led to an Islamic Golden Age, inspiring achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life.[94][95] The Christian and Islamic worlds would eventually clash, with the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire declaring a series of holy wars to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims.[96]\n\nIn the Americas, between 200 and 900 CE Mesoamerica was in its Classic Period,[97] while further north, complex Mississippian societies would arise starting around 800 CE.[98] The Mongol Empire would conquer much of Eurasia in the 13th and 14th centuries.[99] Over this same time period, the Mali Empire in Africa grew to be the largest empire on the continent, stretching from Senegambia to Ivory Coast.[100] Oceania would see the rise of the Tuʻi Tonga Empire which expanded across many islands in the South Pacific.[101] By the late 15th century, the Aztecs and Inca had become the dominant power in Mesoamerica and the Andes, respectively.[102]\n\nThe early modern period in Europe and the Near East ( 1450–1800) began with the final defeat of the Byzantine Empire, and the rise of the Ottoman Empire.[103] Meanwhile, Japan entered the Edo period,[104] the Qing dynasty rose in China[105] and the Mughal Empire ruled much of India.[106] Europe underwent the Renaissance, starting in the 15th century,[107] and the Age of Discovery began with the exploring and colonizing of new regions.[108] This included the colonization of the Americas[109] and the Columbian Exchange.[110] This expansion led to the Atlantic slave trade[111] and the genocide of Native American peoples.[112] This period also marked the Scientific Revolution, with great advances in mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and physiology.[113]\n\nThe late modern period (1800–present) saw the Technological and Industrial Revolution bring such discoveries as imaging technology, major innovations in transport and energy development.[114] Influenced by Enlightenment ideals, the Americas and Europe experienced a period of political revolutions known as the Age of Revolution.[115] The Napoleonic Wars raged through Europe in the early 1800s,[116] Spain lost most of its colonies in the New World,[117] while Europeans continued expansion into Africa – where European control went from 10% to almost 90% in less than 50 years[118] – and Oceania.[119] In the 19th century, the British Empire expanded to become the world's largest empire.[120]\n\nA tenuous balance of power among European nations collapsed in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War, one of the deadliest conflicts in history.[121] In the 1930s, a worldwide economic crisis led to the rise of authoritarian regimes and a Second World War, involving almost all of the world's countries.[122] The war's destruction led to the collapse of most global empires, leading to widespread decolonization.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945, the United States[123] and the USSR emerged as the remaining global superpowers. This led to a Cold War that saw a struggle for global influence, including a nuclear arms race and a space race, ending in the collapse of the Soviet Union.[124][125] The current Information Age, spurred by the development of the Internet and artificial intelligence systems, sees the world becoming increasingly globalized and interconnected.[126]\n\nEarly human settlements were dependent on proximity to water and – depending on the lifestyle – other natural resources used for subsistence, such as populations of animal prey for hunting and arable land for growing crops and grazing livestock.[130] Modern humans, however, have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, irrigation, urban planning, construction, deforestation and desertification.[131] Human settlements continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and with low quality of construction.[132] Grouping and deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of providing protection, accumulating comforts or material wealth, expanding the available food, improving aesthetics, increasing knowledge or enhancing the exchange of resources.[133]\n\nHumans are one of the most adaptable species, despite having a low or narrow tolerance for many of the earth's extreme environments.[134] Currently the species is present in all eight biogeographical realms, although their presence in the Antarctic realm is very limited to research stations and annually there is a population decline in the winter months of this realm. Humans established nation-states in the other seven realms, such as South Africa, India, Russia, Australia, Fiji, United States and Brazil (each located in a different biogeographical realm).\n\nBy using advanced tools and clothing, humans have been able to extend their tolerance to a wide variety of temperatures, humidities, and altitudes.[134][135] As a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found in almost all regions of the world, including tropical rainforest, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and heavily polluted cities; in comparison, most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited adaptability.[136] The human population is not, however, uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface, because the population density varies from one region to another, and large stretches of surface are almost completely uninhabited, like Antarctica and vast swathes of the ocean.[134][137] Most humans (61%) live in Asia; the remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%), Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).[138]\n\nEstimates of the population at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million.[140][141] Around 50–60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.[142] Bubonic plagues, first recorded in the 6th century AD, reduced the population by 50%, with the Black Death killing 75–200 million people in Eurasia and North Africa alone.[143] Human population is believed to have reached one billion in 1800. It has since then increased exponentially, reaching two billion in 1930 and three billion in 1960, four in 1975, five in 1987 and six billion in 1999.[144] It passed seven billion in 2011[145] and passed eight billion in November 2022.[146] It took over two million years of human prehistory and history for the human population to reach one billion and only 207 years more to grow to 7 billion.[147] The combined biomass of the carbon of all the humans on Earth in 2018 was estimated at 60 million tons, about 10 times larger than that of all non-domesticated mammals.[139]\n\nIn 2018, 4.2 billion humans (55%) lived in urban areas, up from 751 million in 1950.[148] The most urbanized regions are Northern America (82%), Latin America (81%), Europe (74%) and Oceania (68%), with Africa and Asia having nearly 90% of the world's 3.4 billion rural population.[148] Problems for humans living in cities include various forms of pollution and crime,[149] especially in inner city and suburban slums.\n\nMost aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. The dental formula of humans is: 2.1.2.32.1.2.3. Humans have proportionately shorter palates and much smaller teeth than other primates. They are the only primates to have short, relatively flush canine teeth. Humans have characteristically crowded teeth, with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young individuals. Humans are gradually losing their third molars, with some individuals having them congenitally absent.[150]\n\nHumans share with chimpanzees a vestigial tail,[151] appendix, flexible shoulder joints, grasping fingers and opposable thumbs.[152] Humans also have a more barrel-shaped chests in contrast to the funnel shape of other apes, an adaptation for bipedal respiration.[153] Apart from bipedalism and brain size, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in smelling, hearing and digesting proteins.[154] While humans have a density of hair follicles comparable to other apes, it is predominantly vellus hair, most of which is so short and wispy as to be practically invisible.[155][156] Humans have about 2 million sweat glands spread over their entire bodies, many more than chimpanzees, whose sweat glands are scarce and are mainly located on the palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet.[157]\n\nIt is estimated that the worldwide average height for an adult human male is about 171 cm (5 ft 7 in), while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about 159 cm (5 ft 3 in).[158] Shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be typical in the extremely aged.[159] Throughout history, human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.[160] The average mass of an adult human is 59 kg (130 lb) for females and 77 kg (170 lb) for males.[161][162] Like many other conditions, body weight and body type are influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals.[163][164]\n\nHumans have a far faster and more accurate throw than other animals.[165] Humans are also among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom, but slower over short distances.[166][154] Humans' thinner body hair and more productive sweat glands help avoid heat exhaustion while running for long distances.[167] Compared to other apes, the human heart produces greater stroke volume and cardiac output and the aorta is proportionately larger.[168][169]\n\nLike most animals, humans are a diploid and eukaryotic species. Each somatic cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes, each set received from one parent; gametes have only one set of chromosomes, which is a mixture of the two parental sets. Among the 23 pairs of chromosomes, there are 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Like other mammals, humans have an XY sex-determination system, so that females have the sex chromosomes XX and males have XY.[170] Genes and environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility and mental abilities. The exact influence of genes and environment on certain traits is not well understood.[171][172]\n\nWhile no humans – not even monozygotic twins – are genetically identical,[173] two humans on average will have a genetic similarity of 99.5%-99.9%.[174][175] This makes them more homogeneous than other great apes, including chimpanzees.[176][177] This small variation in human DNA compared to many other species suggests a population bottleneck during the Late Pleistocene (around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs.[178][179] The forces of natural selection have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the genome display directional selection in the past 15,000 years.[180]\n\nThe human genome was first sequenced in 2001[181] and by 2020 hundreds of thousands of genomes had been sequenced.[182] In 2012 the International HapMap Project had compared the genomes of 1,184 individuals from 11 populations and identified 1.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms.[183] African populations harbor the highest number of private genetic variants. While many of the common variants found in populations outside of Africa are also found on the African continent, there are still large numbers that are private to these regions, especially Oceania and the Americas.[184] By 2010 estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes.[185] By comparing mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.[186][187][188][189]\n\nMost human reproduction takes place by internal fertilization via sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures.[190] The average gestation period is 38 weeks, but a normal pregnancy can vary by up to 37 days.[191] Embryonic development in the human covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus.[192] Humans are able to induce early labor or perform a caesarean section if the child needs to be born earlier for medical reasons.[193] In developed countries, infants are typically 3–4 kg (7–9 lb) in weight and 47–53 cm (19–21 in) in height at birth.[194][195] However, low birth weight is common in developing countries, and contributes to the high levels of infant mortality in these regions.[196]\n\nCompared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous, with a much higher risk of complications and death.[197] The size of the fetus's head is more closely matched to the pelvis than in other primates.[198] The reason for this is not completely understood,[n 3] but it contributes to a painful labor that can last 24 hours or more.[200] The chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and natural childbirth remain hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with maternal death rates approximately 100 times greater than in developed countries.[201]\n\nBoth the mother and the father provide care for human offspring, in contrast to other primates, where parental care is mostly done by the mother.[202] Helpless at birth, humans continue to grow for some years, typically reaching sexual maturity at 15 to 17 years of age.[203][204][205] The human life span has been split into various stages ranging from three to twelve. Common stages include infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age.[206] The lengths of these stages have varied across cultures and time periods but is typified by an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence.[207] Human females undergo menopause and become infertile at around the age of 50.[208] It has been proposed that menopause increases a woman's overall reproductive success by allowing her to invest more time and resources in her existing offspring, and in turn their children (the grandmother hypothesis), rather than by continuing to bear children into old age.[209][210]\n\nThe life span of an individual depends on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices.[211] For various reasons, including biological/genetic causes, women live on average about four years longer than men.[212] As of 2018 , the global average life expectancy at birth of a girl is estimated to be 74.9 years compared to 70.4 for a boy.[213][214] There are significant geographical variations in human life expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development – for example, life expectancy at birth in Hong Kong is 87.6 years for girls and 81.8 for boys, while in the Central African Republic, it is 55.0 years for girls and 50.6 for boys.[215][216] The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40 years. In the developing world, the median age is between 15 and 20 years. While one in five Europeans is 60 years of age or older, only one in twenty Africans is 60 years of age or older.[217] In 2012, the United Nations estimated that there were 316,600 living centenarians (humans of age 100 or older) worldwide.[218]\n\nHumans are omnivorous,[219] capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material.[220][221] Human groups have adopted a range of diets from purely vegan to primarily carnivorous. In some cases, dietary restrictions in humans can lead to deficiency diseases; however, stable human groups have adapted to many dietary patterns through both genetic specialization and cultural conventions to use nutritionally balanced food sources.[222] The human diet is prominently reflected in human culture and has led to the development of food science.[223]\n\nUntil the development of agriculture, Homo sapiens employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection.[223] This involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect larvae and aquatic mollusks) with wild game, which must be hunted and captured in order to be consumed.[224] It has been proposed that humans have used fire to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus.[225] Human domestication of wild plants began about 11,700 years ago, leading to the development of agriculture,[226] a gradual process called the Neolithic Revolution.[227] These dietary changes may also have altered human biology; the spread of dairy farming provided a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest lactose in some adults.[228][229] The types of food consumed, and how they are prepared, have varied widely by time, location, and culture.[230][231]\n\nIn general, humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food, depending on stored body fat.[232] Survival without water is usually limited to three or four days, with a maximum of one week.[233] In 2020 it is estimated 9 million humans die every year from causes directly or indirectly related to starvation.[234][235] Childhood malnutrition is also common and contributes to the global burden of disease.[236] However, global food distribution is not even, and obesity among some human populations has increased rapidly, leading to health complications and increased mortality in some developed and a few developing countries. Worldwide, over one billion people are obese,[237] while in the United States 35% of people are obese, leading to this being described as an \"obesity epidemic.\"[238] Obesity is caused by consuming more calories than are expended, so excessive weight gain is usually caused by an energy-dense diet.[237]\n\nThere is biological variation in the human species – with traits such as blood type, genetic diseases, cranial features, facial features, organ systems, eye color, hair color and texture, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. The typical height of an adult human is between 1.4 and 1.9 m (4 ft 7 in and 6 ft 3 in), although this varies significantly depending on sex, ethnic origin, and family bloodlines.[239][240] Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns.[241]\n\nThere is evidence that populations have adapted genetically to various external factors. The genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication and are more dependent on cow milk.[242] Sickle cell anemia, which may provide increased resistance to malaria, is frequent in populations where malaria is endemic.[243][244] Populations that have for a very long time inhabited specific climates tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for those environments – short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities or other adaptations at high altitudes.[245] Some populations have evolved highly unique adaptations to very specific environmental conditions, such as those advantageous to ocean-dwelling lifestyles and freediving in the Bajau.[246]\n\nHuman hair ranges in color from red to blond to brown to black, which is the most frequent.[247] Hair color depends on the amount of melanin, with concentrations fading with increased age, leading to grey or even white hair. Skin color can range from darkest brown to lightest peach, or even nearly white or colorless in cases of albinism.[248] It tends to vary clinally and generally correlates with the level of ultraviolet radiation in a particular geographic area, with darker skin mostly around the equator.[249] Skin darkening may have evolved as protection against ultraviolet solar radiation.[250] Light skin pigmentation protects against depletion of vitamin D, which requires sunlight to make.[251] Human skin also has a capacity to darken (tan) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.[252][253]\n\nThere is relatively little variation between human geographical populations, and most of the variation that occurs is at the individual level.[248][254][255] Much of human variation is continuous, often with no clear points of demarcation.[256][257][258][259] Genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are defined, two people from the same population group are almost as different from each other as two people from any two different population groups.[260][261][262] Dark-skinned populations that are found in Africa, Australia, and South Asia are not closely related to each other.[263][264]\n\nGenetic research has demonstrated that human populations native to the African continent are the most genetically diverse[265] and genetic diversity decreases with migratory distance from Africa, possibly the result of bottlenecks during human migration.[266][267] These non-African populations acquired new genetic inputs from local admixture with archaic populations and have much greater variation from Neanderthals and Denisovans than is found in Africa,[184] though Neanderthal admixture into African populations may be underestimated.[268] Furthermore, recent studies have found that populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly West Africa, have ancestral genetic variation which predates modern humans and has been lost in most non-African populations. Some of this ancestry is thought to originate from admixture with an unknown archaic hominin that diverged before the split of Neanderthals and modern humans.[269][270]\n\nHumans are a gonochoric species, meaning they are divided into male and female sexes.[271][272][273] The greatest degree of genetic variation exists between males and females. While the nucleotide genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%–0.5%, the genetic difference between males and females is between 1% and 2%. Males on average are 15% heavier and 15 cm (6 in) taller than females.[274][275] On average, men have about 40–50% more upper-body strength and 20–30% more lower-body strength than women at the same weight, due to higher amounts of muscle and larger muscle fibers.[276] Women generally have a higher body fat percentage than men.[277] Women have lighter skin than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D in females during pregnancy and lactation.[278] As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome-related conditions and disorders only affect either men or women.[279] After allowing for body weight and volume, the male voice is usually an octave deeper than the female voice.[280] Women have a longer life span in almost every population around the world.[281] There are intersex conditions in the human population, however these are rare.[282][283]\n\nThe human brain, the focal point of the central nervous system in humans, controls the peripheral nervous system. In addition to controlling \"lower\", involuntary, or primarily autonomic activities such as respiration and digestion, it is also the locus of \"higher\" order functioning such as thought, reasoning, and abstraction.[284] These cognitive processes constitute the mind, and, along with their behavioral consequences, are studied in the field of psychology.\n\nHumans have a larger and more developed prefrontal cortex than other primates, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition.[285][286] This has led humans to proclaim themselves to be more intelligent than any other known species.[287] Objectively defining intelligence is difficult, with other animals adapting senses and excelling in areas that humans are unable to.[288]\n\nThere are some traits that, although not strictly unique, do set humans apart from other animals.[289] Humans may be the only animals who have episodic memory and who can engage in \"mental time travel\".[290] Even compared with other social animals, humans have an unusually high degree of flexibility in their facial expressions.[291] Humans are the only animals known to cry emotional tears.[292] Humans are one of the few animals able to self-recognize in mirror tests[293] and there is also debate over to what extent humans are the only animals with a theory of mind.[294][295]\n\nHumans are generally diurnal. The average sleep requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Having less sleep than this is common among humans, even though sleep deprivation can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort.[296]\n\nDuring sleep humans dream, where they experience sensory images and sounds. Dreaming is stimulated by the pons and mostly occurs during the REM phase of sleep.[297] The length of a dream can vary, from a few seconds up to 30 minutes.[298] Humans have three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven.[299] Dreamers are more likely to remember the dream if awakened during the REM phase. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware.[300] Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur or give a sense of inspiration.[301]\n\nHuman consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience or awareness of internal or external existence.[302] Despite centuries of analyses, definitions, explanations and debates by philosophers and scientists, consciousness remains puzzling and controversial,[303] being \"at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives\".[304] The only widely agreed notion about the topic is the intuition that it exists.[305] Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied and explained as consciousness. Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is sensory experience itself, and access consciousness, which can be used for reasoning or directly controlling actions.[306] It is sometimes synonymous with 'the mind', and at other times, an aspect of it. Historically it is associated with introspection, private thought, imagination and volition.[307] It now often includes some kind of experience, cognition, feeling or perception. It may be 'awareness', or 'awareness of awareness', or self-awareness.[308] There might be different levels or orders of consciousness,[309] or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features.[310]\n\nThe process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses is known as cognition.[311] The human brain perceives the external world through the senses, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her experiences, leading to subjective views of existence and the passage of time.[312] The nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes underlying behavior.[313] Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age.[314][315] This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. Psychologists have developed intelligence tests and the concept of intelligence quotient in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its distribution among population.[316]\n\nHuman motivation is not yet wholly understood. From a psychological perspective, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a well-established theory that can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity.[317] From a more general, philosophical perspective, human motivation can be defined as a commitment to, or withdrawal from, various goals requiring the application of human ability. Furthermore, incentive and preference are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. Volition may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and realization of goals in an optimal manner, a function beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as socialization.[318]\n\nEmotions are biological states associated with the nervous system[319][320] brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure.[321][322] They are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity,[323] and motivation. Emotion has a significant influence on human behavior and their ability to learn.[324] Acting on extreme or uncontrolled emotions can lead to social disorder and crime,[325] with studies showing criminals may have a lower emotional intelligence than normal.[326]\n\nEmotional experiences perceived as pleasant, such as joy, interest or contentment, contrast with those perceived as unpleasant, like anxiety, sadness, anger, and despair.[327] Happiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some define it as experiencing the feeling of positive emotional affects, while avoiding the negative ones.[328][329] Others see it as an appraisal of life satisfaction or quality of life.[330] Recent research suggests that being happy might involve experiencing some negative emotions when humans feel they are warranted.[331]\n\nFor humans, sexuality involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors.[332][333] Because it is a broad term, which has varied with historical contexts over time, it lacks a precise definition.[333] The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual response cycle.[332][333] Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life.[332][333] Sexual desire, or libido, is a basic mental state present at the beginning of sexual behavior. Studies show that men desire sex more than women and masturbate more often.[334]\n\nHumans can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of sexual orientation,[335] although most humans are heterosexual.[336][337] While homosexual behavior occurs in some other animals, only humans and domestic sheep have so far been found to exhibit exclusive preference for same-sex relationships.[336] Most evidence supports nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation,[336] as cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it.[337][338] Research in neuroscience and genetics suggests that other aspects of human sexuality are biologically influenced as well.[339]\n\nLove most commonly refers to a feeling of strong attraction or emotional attachment. It can be impersonal (the love of an object, ideal, or strong political or spiritual connection) or interpersonal (love between humans).[340] When in love dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and other chemicals stimulate the brain's pleasure center, leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement.[341]\n\nHumanity's unprecedented set of intellectual skills were a key factor in the species' eventual technological advancement and concomitant domination of the biosphere.[345] Disregarding extinct hominids, humans are the only animals known to teach generalizable information,[346] innately deploy recursive embedding to generate and communicate complex concepts,[347] engage in the \"folk physics\" required for competent tool design,[348][349] or cook food in the wild.[350] Teaching and learning preserves the cultural and ethnographic identity of human societies.[351] Other traits and behaviors that are mostly unique to humans include starting fires,[352] phoneme structuring[353] and vocal learning.[354]\n\nWhile many species communicate, language is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a cultural universal.[355] Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open – an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols.[356][357] Human language also has the capacity of displacement, using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.[150]\n\nLanguage differs from other forms of communication in that it is modality independent; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, audibly in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and through tactile media such as braille.[358] Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups.[359] There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many thousands more that are extinct.[360]\n\nHuman arts can take many forms including visual, literary, and performing. Visual art can range from paintings and sculptures to film, fashion design, and architecture.[361] Literary arts can include prose, poetry, and dramas. The performing arts generally involve theatre, music, and dance.[362][363] Humans often combine the different forms (for example, music videos).[364] Other entities that have been described as having artistic qualities include food preparation, video games, and medicine.[365][366][367] As well as providing entertainment and transferring knowledge, the arts are also used for political purposes.[368]\n\nArt is a defining characteristic of humans and there is evidence for a relationship between creativity and language.[369] The earliest evidence of art was shell engravings made by Homo erectus 300,000 years before modern humans evolved.[370] Art attributed to H. sapiens existed at least 75,000 years ago, with jewellery and drawings found in caves in South Africa.[371][372] There are various hypotheses as to why humans have adapted to the arts. These include allowing them to better problem solve issues, providing a means to control or influence other humans, encouraging cooperation and contribution within a society or increasing the chance of attracting a potential mate.[373] The use of imagination developed through art, combined with logic may have given early humans an evolutionary advantage.[369]\n\nEvidence of humans engaging in musical activities predates cave art and so far music has been practiced by virtually all known human cultures.[374] There exists a wide variety of music genres and ethnic musics; with humans' musical abilities being related to other abilities, including complex social human behaviours.[374] It has been shown that human brains respond to music by becoming synchronized with the rhythm and beat, a process called entrainment.[375] Dance is also a form of human expression found in all cultures[376] and may have evolved as a way to help early humans communicate.[377] Listening to music and observing dance stimulates the orbitofrontal cortex and other pleasure sensing areas of the brain.[378]\n\nUnlike speaking, reading and writing does not come naturally to humans and must be taught.[379] Still, literature has been present before the invention of words and language, with 30,000-year-old paintings on walls inside some caves portraying a series of dramatic scenes.[380] One of the oldest surviving works of literature is the Epic of Gilgamesh, first engraved on ancient Babylonian tablets about 4,000 years ago.[381] Beyond simply passing down knowledge, the use and sharing of imaginative fiction through stories might have helped develop humans' capabilities for communication and increased the likelihood of securing a mate.[382] Storytelling may also be used as a way to provide the audience with moral lessons and encourage cooperation.[380]\n\nStone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5 million years ago.[384] The use and manufacture of tools has been put forward as the ability that defines humans more than anything else[385] and has historically been seen as an important evolutionary step.[386] The technology became much more sophisticated about 1.8 million years ago,[385] with the controlled use of fire beginning around 1 million years ago.[387][388] The wheel and wheeled vehicles appeared simultaneously in several regions some time in the fourth millennium BC.[68] The development of more complex tools and technologies allowed land to be cultivated and animals to be domesticated, thus proving essential in the development of agriculture – what is known as the Neolithic Revolution.[389]\n\nChina developed paper, the printing press, gunpowder, the compass and other important inventions.[390] The continued improvements in smelting allowed forging of copper, bronze, iron and eventually steel, which is used in railways, skyscrapers and many other products.[391] This coincided with the Industrial Revolution, where the invention of automated machines brought major changes to humans' lifestyles.[392] Modern technology is observed as progressing exponentially,[393] with major innovations in the 20th century including: electricity, penicillin, semiconductors, internal combustion engines, the Internet, nitrogen fixing fertilizers, airplanes, computers, automobiles, contraceptive pills, nuclear fission, the green revolution, radio, scientific plant breeding, rockets, air conditioning, television and the assembly line.[394]\n\nDefinitions of religion vary;[395] according to one definition, a religion is a belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution and the history of the first religions have become areas of active scientific investigation.[396][397][398] Credible evidence of religious behaviour dates to the Middle Paleolithic era (45–200 thousand years ago).[399] It may have evolved to play a role in helping enforce and encourage cooperation between humans.[400]\n\nReligion manifests in diverse forms.[395] Religion can include a belief in life after death,[401] the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and moral or ethical teachings.[402] Views on transcendence and immanence vary substantially; traditions variously espouse monism, deism, pantheism, and theism (including polytheism and monotheism).[403]\n\nAlthough measuring religiosity is difficult,[404] a majority of humans profess some variety of religious or spiritual belief.[405] In 2015 the plurality were Christian followed by Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists.[406] As of 2015, about 16%, or slightly under 1.2 billion humans, were irreligious, including those with no religious beliefs or no identity with any religion.[407]\n\nAn aspect unique to humans is their ability to transmit knowledge from one generation to the next and to continually build on this information to develop tools, scientific laws and other advances to pass on further.[408] This accumulated knowledge can be tested to answer questions or make predictions about how the universe functions and has been very successful in advancing human ascendancy.[409]\n\nAristotle has been described as the first scientist,[410] and preceded the rise of scientific thought through the Hellenistic period.[411] Other early advances in science came from the Han dynasty in China and during the Islamic Golden Age.[412][94] The scientific revolution, near the end of the Renaissance, led to the emergence of modern science.[413]\n\nA chain of events and influences led to the development of the scientific method, a process of observation and experimentation that is used to differentiate science from pseudoscience.[414] An understanding of mathematics is unique to humans, although other species of animals have some numerical cognition.[415] All of science can be divided into three major branches, the formal sciences (e.g., logic and mathematics), which are concerned with formal systems, the applied sciences (e.g., engineering, medicine), which are focused on practical applications, and the empirical sciences, which are based on empirical observation and are in turn divided into natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) and social sciences (e.g., psychology, economics, sociology).[416]\n\nPhilosophy is a field of study where humans seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves and the world in which they live.[417] Philosophical inquiry has been a major feature in the development of humans' intellectual history.[418] It has been described as the \"no man's land\" between definitive scientific knowledge and dogmatic religious teachings.[419] Major fields of philosophy include metaphysics, epistemology, logic, and axiology (which includes ethics and aesthetics).[420]\n\nSociety is the system of organizations and institutions arising from interaction between humans. Humans are highly social and tend to live in large complex social groups. They can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, power, reputation and other factors. The structure of social stratification and the degree of social mobility differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.[421] Human groups range from the size of families to nations. The first form of human social organization is thought to have resembled hunter-gatherer band societies.[422]\n\nHuman societies typically exhibit gender identities and gender roles that distinguish between masculine and feminine characteristics and prescribe the range of acceptable behaviours and attitudes for their members based on their sex.[423][424] The most common categorisation is a gender binary of men and women.[425] Some societies recognize a third gender,[426] or less commonly a fourth or fifth.[427][428] In some other societies, non-binary is used as an umbrella term for a range of gender identities that are not solely male or female.[429]\n\nGender roles are often associated with a division of norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power, with men enjoying more rights and privileges than women in most societies, both today and in the past.[430] As a social construct,[431] gender roles are not fixed and vary historically within a society. Challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.[432][433] Little is known about gender roles in the earliest human societies. Early modern humans probably had a range of gender roles similar to that of modern cultures from at least the Upper Paleolithic, while the Neanderthals were less sexually dimorphic and there is evidence that the behavioural difference between males and females was minimal.[434]\n\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents, children and other descendants (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). There is also a third type applied to godparents or adoptive children (fictive). These culturally defined relationships are referred to as kinship. In many societies, it is one of the most important social organizing principles and plays a role in transmitting status and inheritance.[435] All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations is prohibited, and some also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations.[436]\n\nPair bonding is a ubiquitous feature of human sexual relationships, whether it is manifested as serial monogamy, polygyny, or polyandry.[437] Genetic evidence indicates that humans were predominantly polygynous for most of their existence as a species, but that this began to shift during the Neolithic, when monogamy started becoming widespread concomitantly with the transition from nomadic to sedentary societies.[438] Anatomical evidence in the form of second-to-fourth digit ratios, a biomarker for prenatal androgen effects, likewise indicates modern humans were polygynous during the Pleistocene.[439]\n\nHuman ethnic groups are a social category that identifies together as a group based on shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. These can be a common set of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area.[440][441] Ethnicity is separate from the concept of race, which is based on physical characteristics, although both are socially constructed.[442] Assigning ethnicity to a certain population is complicated, as even within common ethnic designations there can be a diverse range of subgroups, and the makeup of these ethnic groups can change over time at both the collective and individual level.[176] Also, there is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an ethnic group.[443] Ethnic groupings can play a powerful role in the social identity and solidarity of ethnopolitical units. This has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.[444][445][446]\n\nAs farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between these different groups increased. This led to the development of governance within and between the communities.[447] Humans have evolved the ability to change affiliation with various social groups relatively easily, including previously strong political alliances, if doing so is seen as providing personal advantages.[448] This cognitive flexibility allows individual humans to change their political ideologies, with those with higher flexibility less likely to support authoritarian and nationalistic stances.[449]\n\nGovernments create laws and policies that affect the citizens that they govern. There have been many forms of government throughout human history, each having various means of obtaining power and the ability to exert diverse controls on the population.[450] Approximately 47% of humans live in some form of a democracy, 17% in a hybrid regime, and 37% in an authoritarian regime.[451] Many countries belong to international organizations and alliances; the largest of these is the United Nations, with 193 member states.[452]\n\nTrade, the voluntary exchange of goods and services, is seen as a characteristic that differentiates humans from other animals and has been cited as a practice that gave Homo sapiens a major advantage over other hominids.[453] Evidence suggests early H. sapiens made use of long-distance trade routes to exchange goods and ideas, leading to cultural explosions and providing additional food sources when hunting was sparse, while such trade networks did not exist for the now extinct Neanderthals.[454][455] Early trade likely involved materials for creating tools like obsidian.[456] The first truly international trade routes were around the spice trade through the Roman and medieval periods.[457]\n\nEarly human economies were more likely to be based around gift giving instead of a bartering system.[458] Early money consisted of commodities; the oldest being in the form of cattle and the most widely used being cowrie shells.[459] Money has since evolved into governmental issued coins, paper and electronic money.[459] Human study of economics is a social science that looks at how societies distribute scarce resources among different people.[460] There are massive inequalities in the division of wealth among humans; the eight richest humans are worth the same monetary value as the poorest half of all the human population.[461]\n\nHumans commit violence on other humans at a rate comparable to other primates, but have an increased preference for killing adults, infanticide being more common among other primates.[462] Phylogenetic analysis predicts that 2% of early H. sapiens would be murdered, rising to 12% during the medieval period, before dropping to below 2% in modern times.[463] There is great variation in violence between human populations, with rates of homicide about 0.01% in societies that have legal systems and strong cultural attitudes against violence.[464]\n\nThe willingness of humans to kill other members of their species en masse through organized conflict (i.e., war) has long been the subject of debate. One school of thought holds that war evolved as a means to eliminate competitors, and has always been an innate human characteristic. Another suggests that war is a relatively recent phenomenon and has appeared due to changing social conditions.[465] While not settled, current evidence indicates warlike predispositions only became common about 10,000 years ago, and in many places much more recently than that.[465] War has had a high cost on human life; it is estimated that during the 20th century, between 167 million and 188 million people died as a result of war.[466] War casualty data is less reliable for pre-medieval times, especially global figures. But compared with any period over the past 600 years, the last ~80 years (post 1946), has seen a very significant drop in global military and civilian death rates due to armed conflict.[467]Humans (TV Series 2015–2018) ⭐ 7.9 | Drama, Sci-Fi: Humans is an unexpectedly great show. The reason for this is that it's understated in the technology an emphasizes the humanity. The cast are all from UK and mostly unknown and it allows us to get to know the characters more. Gemma Chan who plays Anita/Mya led me to this series via her Twitter. I first saw her in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.\n\n\n\nThis series is dark and brooding. It raises more questions than it answers with the interaction between the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Synths and the Humans who \"employ\" them to do ordinary household tasks.\n\n\n\nThe origins of the core group of Synths is a mystery that is weave through the course of this series. There is some limited action, violence and beneath all of that big question about the ghost in the machine. This may be the best follow-up on ideas of sentient robots first presented since Blade Runner.Humans (TV series) - Wikipedia: Humans is a science fiction television series that debuted in June 2015 on Channel 4 and on AMC. Written by Jonathan Brackley and Sam Vincent, based on the Swedish science fiction drama Real Humans, the series explores the themes of artificial intelligence, robotics, and their effects on the future of humanity, focusing on the social, cultural, and psychological impact of the invention and marketing of anthropomorphic robots called \"synths\".
