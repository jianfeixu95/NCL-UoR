V.), a registered voluntary association under German law\nSwiss Verein, a voluntary association under Swiss law, not necessarily registered\n\nSeinen manga (\u9752\u5e74\u6f2b\u753b) is an editorial category of Japanese comics marketed toward young adult men. In Japanese, the word seinen means \"youth\", but the term \"seinen manga\" is also used to describe the target audience of magazines like Weekly Manga Times and Weekly Manga Goraku, which write on topics of interest to male university students and workingmen. Seinen manga is distinguished from sh\u014dnen manga, which is for young boys, and seijin-muke manga, which are intended for adult audiences and often contain explicit content.  Some seinen manga like xxxHolic share similarities with sh\u014dnen manga. Seinen manga can focus on action, politics, science fiction, fantasy, relationships, sports, or comedy. The female equivalent to seinen manga is josei manga.\nA common way to tell if a manga is seinen is by looking at whether furigana is used over the original kanji text: if there is furigana on all kanji, the title is generally aimed at a younger audience. The title of the magazine in which it was published is also an important indicator. Usually, Japanese manga magazines with the word \"young\" in the title (Weekly Young Jump, for instance) are seinen. There are also mixed sh\u014dnen/seinen magazines such as Gangan Powered and Comp Ace. Other popular seinen manga magazines include Weekly Young Magazine, Weekly Young Sunday, Big Comic Spirits, Business Jump, Ultra Jump, and Afternoon.\nIn 1959, two of the main sh\u014dnen manga titles appeared: Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine and Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday. Then, in 1967, the first magazine aimed at seinen appeared: Weekly Manga Action, which scored big hits with Lupin III, Lone Wolf and Cub, and later Crayon Shin-chan. The year 1972 saw the addition of Big Comic Original, which featured Tsuribaka Nisshi, a manga about two older men who enjoy fishing; the manga was made into a series of popular movies. In 1979, the publisher Shueisha, known for Weekly Shonen Jump for teen boys, entered the seinen market with Weekly Young Jump. Many Young Jump series have been adapted into anime or live-action TV programs, such as Elfen Lied, Gantz, Hen, Kirara, Liar Game, Oku-sama wa Joshi K\u014dsei, and Dragon Ball.\n\n",

        "combined_context": "Count Carl Axel L\u00f6wenhielm (3 November 1772 \u2013 9 June 1861) was a Swedish military officer, diplomat, and politician.\nL\u00f6wenhielm was an illegitimate son of King Charles XIII of Sweden and Augusta von Fersen (married to the Chancellor of the Royal Court Fredrik Adolf L\u00f6wenhielm) and a half-brother of general and diplomat Gustaf L\u00f6wenhielm.\nL\u00f6wenhielm participated in the war operations in Finland in 1788\u20131790, in Pomerania in 1807, on the Norwegian border and on \u00c5land in 1809.  He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1808, in 1812 to the General Adjuster, in 1814 to Major General and in 1815 to the Lieutenant-General.  L\u00f6wenhielm was a member of the Swedish cabinet between 1822\u20131839 and represented Sweden at the Congress of Vienna.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\nSaint Petersburg, formerly known as Petrograd and later Leningrad, is the second-largest city in Russia after Moscow. It is situated on the River Neva, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea. The city had a population of 5,601,911 residents as of 2021, with more than 6.4 million people living in the metropolitan area. Saint Petersburg is the fourth-most populous city in Europe, the most populous city on the Baltic Sea, and the world's northernmost city of more than 1 million residents. As the former capital of Imperial Russia, and a historically strategic port, it is governed as a federal city.\nThe city was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on 27 May 1703 on the site of a captured Swedish fortress, and was named after the apostle Saint Peter. In Russia, Saint Petersburg is historically and culturally associated with the birth of the Russian Empire and Russia's entry into modern history as a European great power. It served as a capital of the Tsardom of Russia, and the subsequent Russian Empire, from 1712 to 1918 (being replaced by Moscow for a short period of time between 1728 and 1730). After the October Revolution in 1917, the Bolsheviks moved their government to Moscow. The city was renamed Leningrad after Lenin's death in 1924. It was the site of the siege of Leningrad during the Second World War, the most lethal siege in history. In June 1991, only a few months before the Belovezha Accords and the dissolution of the USSR, voters supported restoring the city's original appellation in a city-wide referendum.\nAs Russia's cultural centre, Saint Petersburg received over 15 million tourists in 2018. It is considered an important economic, scientific, and tourism centre of Russia and Europe. In modern times, the city has the nickname of being \"the Northern Capital of Russia\" and is home to notable federal government bodies such as the Constitutional Court of Russia and the Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation. It is also a seat for the National Library of Russia and a planned location for the Supreme Court of Russia, as well as the home to the headquarters of the Russian Navy, and the Leningrad Military District of the Russian Armed Forces. The Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments constitute a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Saint Petersburg is home to the Hermitage, one of the largest art museums in the world, the Lakhta Center, the tallest skyscraper in Europe, and was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetersburg, or Petersburgh, may refer to:\nZeit may refer to:\nCarl may refer to:\n\nCarl, Georgia, city in USA\nCarl, West Virginia, an unincorporated community\nCarl (name), includes info about the name, variations of the name, and a list of people with the name\nCarl\u00b2, a TV series\n\"Carl\", an episode of television series Aqua Teen Hunger Force\nAn informal nickname for a student or alum of Carleton College\nCARL may refer to:\n\nCanadian Association of Research Libraries\nColorado Alliance of Research Libraries\nAxel may refer to:\nL\u00f6wenhielm is a surname.

It is generally characterized by widespread violence, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.\nWhile some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic, or ecological circumstances.",

It is the color of objects such as snow, chalk, and milk, and is the opposite of black. White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light. White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red, blue, and green light. The color white can be given with white pigments, especially titanium dioxide.\nIn ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore white togas as symbols of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the kings of France as well as the flag of monachist France from 1815 to 1830, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922). Greek temples and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols, and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.\nAccording to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude. White is an important color for almost all world religions. The pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. In Islam, and in the Shinto religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning.\nCollar may refer to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "combined_context": "\n\nThe Love Boat is an American romantic comedy-drama television series created by Wilford Lloyd Baumes that originally aired on ABC from September 24, 1977, to May 24, 1986. In addition, three TV movies aired before the regular series premiered and four specials and a TV movie aired after the series ended. The series was set on the cruise ship MS Pacific Princess, and revolved around the ship's captain Merrill Stubing (played by Gavin MacLeod) and a handful of his crew, with passengers played by guest actors for each episode, having romantic, dramatic and humorous adventures.\nThe series was part of ABC's popular Saturday-night lineup of the time, which also included Fantasy Island until 1984. The executive producer for the series was Aaron Spelling, who produced several television series for Four Star Television and ABC from the 1960s into the 1990s.\nThe series was nominated four consecutive times for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy between 1978 and 1981, without winning any. Gavin MacLeod and Lauren Tewes also received several Golden Globe nominations for their roles in the series. In 1997, the episode with segment titles \"Hidden Treasure\", \"Picture from the Past\", and \"Ace's Salary\" (season 9, episode 3) was ranked No. 82 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list.\n\nTheodore William Lange III (; born January 5, 1948) is an American actor, director and screenwriter best known for his roles as bartender Isaac Washington in the TV series The Love Boat (1977\u20131986) and Junior in That's My Mama (1974\u201375).\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries may refer to:\nLove encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, or the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment.\nLove is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection\u2014\"the unselfish, loyal, and benevolent concern for the good of another\"\u2014and its vice representing a human moral flaw akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism. It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, oneself, or animals. In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships, and owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.\nAncient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: familial love (storge), friendly love or platonic love (philia), romantic love (eros), self-love (philautia), guest love (xenia), and divine or unconditional love (agape). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: fatuous love, unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love (limerence), amour de soi, and courtly love. Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafun\u00e9, Kama, Bhakti, Mett\u0101, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regard to specified \"moments\" currently lacking in the English language.\nThe color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary, and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel. The triangular theory of love suggests intimacy, passion, and commitment are core components of love. Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.\nA boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size or capacity, its shape, or its ability to carry boats.\nSmall boats are typically used on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats (such as whaleboats) were intended for offshore use. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.\nBoats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats. House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. Lighters are used to move cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions.\nBoats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. rowboats and paddle boats), wind  (e.g. sailboats), and inboard/outboard motors (including gasoline, diesel, and electric).\nRolle (French pronunciation: [\u0281\u0254l]) is a municipality in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It was the seat of the district of Rolle until 2006, when it became part of the district of Nyon. It is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man) between Nyon and Lausanne. Rolle is approximately 30 kilometers (19 mi) northeast of Geneva (Gen\u00e8ve) in the La C\u00f4te wine-growing region, and has views of the high Alps.\nRolle is also the birthplace of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de la Harpe (1754\u20131838), who was the tutor of Alexander I of Russia and was largely responsible for the independence of the Canton of Vaud from the Bernese.\nTed may refer to:\nLange may refer to:\nWelche is a little-spoken Gallo-Romance dialect of Alsace. A Lorrain dialect, it is closely related to French by the O\u00efl group. Its varieties include those of Bruche, Vill\u00e9, Li\u00e8pvre, Kaysersberg and Orbey.\nThe name Welche is a French spelling of Welsh, a word from Germanic languages such as English, used originally to refer to Celtic speakers such as the Welsh, and later to Latin speakers after Latin was imposed on the Celts. The word Welsh has been adopted in Latin dialects (such as French) to refer exclusively to other Latin dialects (such as Welche). Welche, Welsh and English are all distantly related through the Indo-European group and language-mixing.\n\nDer or DER may refer to:",

Claremont is best known for his 16-year stint on Uncanny X-Men from 1975 to 1991, far longer than that of any other writer, during which he is credited with developing strong female characters as well as introducing complex literary themes into superhero narratives, turning the once underachieving comic into one of Marvel's most popular series. During his tenure, X-Men was the best-selling comic book in the world.\nDuring his tenure at Marvel, Claremont co-created numerous X-Men characters, such as Rogue, Psylocke (Betsy Braddock), Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat, Phoenix, the Brood, Lockheed, Shi'ar, Shi'ar Imperial Guard, Mystique, Destiny, Selene, Reverend William Stryker, Lady Mastermind, Emma Frost, Tessa, Siryn, Jubilee, Rachel Summers, Madelyne Pryor, Moira MacTaggert, Lilandra, Shadow King, Cannonball, Warpath, Mirage, Wolfsbane, Karma, Cypher, Sabretooth, Empath, Sebastian Shaw, Donald Pierce, Avalanche, Pyro, Legion, Nimrod,   Gateway, Strong Guy, Proteus, Mister Sinister, Marauders, Purifiers, Captain Britain, Sunspot, Forge, and Gambit.\nClaremont wrote many classic stories, including \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" and \"Days of Future Past\", on which he collaborated with John Byrne. He developed the character of Wolverine into a fan favorite. X-Men #1, the 1991 spinoff series premiere that Claremont co-wrote with Jim Lee, remains the bestselling comic book of all time, according to Guinness World Records. In 2015, Claremont and his X-Men collaborator John Byrne were entered into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaremont may refer to:\n\n\nPatrick Leguidecoq (known professionally as Romane; born 1959 in Paris, France) is a guitarist who specializes in gypsy jazz.\n\nChris is a short form of various names including Christopher, Christian, Christina, and Christine. Chris is also used as a name in its own right, however it is not as common.\nWie or WIE may refer to:\n\nY, the twenty-fifth letter of the Latin alphabet, pronounced wie",

It lies in the Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region\u2014Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr\u2014which also encompasses the cities of Frankfurt am Main, Wiesbaden, Darmstadt, Offenbach am Main, and Hanau.\nMainz is located at the northern end of the Upper Rhine Plain, on the left bank of the Rhine, opposite the Hessian capital of Wiesbaden and the mouth of the River Main into the Rhine. It is the largest city of Rhenish Hesse, a region of Rhineland-Palatinate that was historically part of Hesse, and is one of Germany's most important wine regions because of its mild climate. Mainz is connected to Frankfurt am Main by the Rhine-Main S-Bahn rapid transit system. Before 1945, Mainz had six boroughs on the other side of the Rhine (see: de:Rechtsrheinische Stadtteile von Mainz). Three have been incorporated into Wiesbaden (see: de:AKK-Konflikt), and three are now independent.\nMainz was founded as Castrum Mogontiacum by Roman general Nero Claudius Drusus in the 1st century BC on the northern frontier of the Roman Empire,  and became the capital of the Roman province of Germania Superior. The city was settled by the Franks from 459 on, and in the 8th century it became an important city within the Holy Roman Empire, as capital of the Electorate of Mainz and seat of the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz, the primate of Germany. Mainz Cathedral is one of the three Rhenish Imperial Cathedrals along with Speyer Cathedral and Worms Cathedral.\nSince the 12th century, Mainz was one of the ShUM-cities\u2014a league formed by the cities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz\u2014which are referred to as the cradle of Ashkenazi Jewish life and as the center of Jewish life during Medieval times. The Jewish heritage of these cities is one of a kind, and has been declared the UNESCO World Heritage Site of \"ShUM Sites of Speyer, Worms and Mainz\", which includes the Judensand (Jews' Sand), the second-oldest Jewish cemetery in Europe after the Heiliger Sand in Worms.\nMainz is the birthplace of Johannes Gutenberg, who introduced letterpress printing to Europe with his movable type printing press, starting the global spread of the printing press, and in the early 1450s manufactured his first books in the city, including the Gutenberg Bibles, two of which are kept at the city's Gutenberg Museum. Mainz was heavily damaged in World War II; more than 30 air raids destroyed around half of the old town in the city centre, but many buildings were rebuilt post-war.\nLike most cities in the Rhineland, Mainz holds extensive carnival celebrations, that are known as the second-most important in Germany, after the celebrations in Cologne. The borough of Lerchenberg is the seat of ZDF (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen, lit. \"Second German Television\"), the second-most important German public service television broadcaster, as well as of 3sat, another television broadcaster, that is jointly operated by public broadcasters from Germany (ARD and ZDF), Austria (ORF), and Switzerland (SRG SSR).\n\nBischofsheim may refer to the following towns:\n\nBischofsheim, Hesse, in Hesse, Germany\nMaintal-Bischofsheim, a district of the city of Maintal in Hesse, Germany\nBischofsheim in der Rh\u00f6n, in Bavaria, Germany\nBischoffsheim, in Bas-Rhin, France\nBischofsheim as part of name\n\nGau-Bischofsheim, Rheinland-Pfalz\nNeckarbischofsheim, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\nRheinbischofsheim, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\nTauberbischofsheim, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\nA quarter is a part of an urban settlement.\nA quarter can be administratively defined and its borders officially designated, and it may have its own administrative structure (subordinate to that of the city, town or other urban area). Such a division is particularly common in countries like Bulgaria (Bulgarian: \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b, romanized: kvartal), Croatia (\u010detvrt), France (Quartier), Georgia (\u10d9\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10e2\u10d0\u10da\u10d8, k'vart'ali),  Italy (Quartiere), Romania (Cartier), and Serbia (\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0442 / \u010detvrt). It may be denoted as a borough (in English-speaking countries), Portugal/Brazil (bairro), Spain (barrio); or some other term (e.g. Cambodia (\u179f\u1784\u17d2\u1780\u17b6\u178f\u17cb sangkat), Germany (Stadtteil), and Poland (dzielnica)).\nQuarter can also refer to a non-administrative but distinct neighbourhood with its own character: for example, a slum quarter. It is often used for a district connected with a particular group of people: for instance, some cities are said to have Jewish quarters, diplomatic quarters or Bohemian quarters.\nWie or WIE may refer to:\n\nY, the twenty-fifth letter of the Latin alphabet, pronounced wie\nLange may refer to:\nWar is an armed conflict between the armed forces of states, or between governmental forces and armed groups that are organized under a certain command structure and have the capacity to sustain military operations, or between such organized groups. It is generally characterized by widespread violence, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.\nWhile some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic, or ecological circumstances.\nEin or EIN may refer to:",

It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films and other television series. It is a spin-off from the first Marvel Netflix series, Daredevil (2015\u20132018). The Punisher was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios and Bohemian Risk Productions, with Lightfoot serving as showrunner.\nJon Bernthal reprises his role from Daredevil as Frank Castle / Punisher, a vigilante who uses lethal methods to fight crime. Ben Barnes, Amber Rose Revah, Jason R. Moore, and Deborah Ann Woll also star. They are joined by Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Daniel Webber, Paul Schulze, Michael Nathanson, and Jaime Ray Newman in the first season, with Josh Stewart, Floriana Lima, and Giorgia Whigham joining for the second season. A television series centered on the Punisher received a put pilot commitment at Fox in 2011, but that project fell through. In June 2015, Bernthal was cast as the character to appear in the second season of Daredevil. Development on a spin-off began by January 2016, and Netflix ordered the series that April when the involvement of Bernthal and Lightfoot was confirmed. The series explores the title character's grief and violence, and was filmed in New York City.\nThe first season was released in its entirety on Netflix on November 17, 2017, followed by the second on January 18, 2019. They were met with mixed reviews, but received several accolades including a Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination. Netflix cancelled The Punisher on February 18, 2019. All of the Marvel Netflix series were removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the license for them. They began streaming on Disney+ from March 16. Bernthal will reprise his role as Frank Castle in the upcoming Marvel Studios Disney+ series Daredevil: Born Again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Punisher (Francis \"Frank\" Castle, born Castiglione) is an antihero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Gerry Conway and artists John Romita Sr. and Ross Andru. The Punisher made his first appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #129 (cover-dated February 1974), originally depicted as an assassin and adversary of the superhero Spider-Man.\nThe character is depicted as an Italian-American vigilante who employs murder, kidnapping, extortion, coercion, threats of violence, and torture in his campaign against crime. Driven by the deaths of his wife and two children, who were killed by the mob for witnessing a killing in New York City's Central Park, the Punisher wages a one-man war on crime.  Castle is a veteran U.S. Marine Corps Scout/Sniper in Force Recon. The stories initially place his military service in the Vietnam War, but this was much later updated alternately to the fictional Siancong War and the Iraq War. Castle is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, guerrilla warfare, and marksmanship. He is well known for the skull motif on his chest, envisioned by his creators as a skull-and-crossbones symbol on his right breast. In the 2022 run featuring the character, after joining The Hand, Castle adopts a new logo inspired by the Japanese mythological demon Oni.\nThe Punisher's brutal nature and willingness to kill made him an anomaly in mainstream American comic books when he debuted in 1974. By the late 1980s, the Punisher was part of a wave of psychologically troubled antiheroes. At the height of his popularity, the character was featured in four monthly publications: The Punisher, The Punisher War Journal, The Punisher: War Zone, and The Punisher Armory. An alternate future version of the character dubbed the \"Cosmic Ghost Rider\", created by Donny Cates and Geoff Shaw, began publication in 2018 as a Thanos supporting character, becoming a breakout character and receiving his own ongoing series, often coming into opposition with his past self. In 2017, following the 2016 Civil War II storyline, where Jim \"Rhodey\" Rhodes met his death at the hands of Thanos, Nick Fury, Jr. obtained the War Machine armor from a black market syndicate and persuaded Punisher to don the armor and carry on in Rhodes' name, succeeding him as the second War Machine for a short while, customizing the armor with his skull motif. Following Rhodes' resurrection alongside Tony Stark for the Marvel Legacy initiative, Castle relinquished the armor and title to him and resumed as Punisher.\nDespite his violent actions and dark nature, the Punisher has enjoyed some mainstream success on television, making guest appearances on series such as Spider-Man and The Super Hero Squad Show, where the depiction of his violent behavior was toned down for family viewers.\nIn feature films, Dolph Lundgren portrayed the character in the 1989 film The Punisher, as did Thomas Jane in the 2004 film The Punisher, and Ray Stevenson in 2008's Punisher: War Zone. Jon Bernthal portrayed the character in the second season of Daredevil, the spin-off The Punisher and will reprise the role in Daredevil: Born Again, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\n\nIn the Book of Genesis, Dinah (; Hebrew: \u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4, Modern: D\u012bna, Tiberian: D\u012bn\u0101, 'judged'; 'vindicated') was the seventh child and only daughter of Leah and Jacob. The episode of her violation by Shechem, son of a Canaanite or Hivite prince, and the subsequent vengeance of her brothers Simeon and Levi, commonly referred to as the rape of Dinah, is told in Genesis 34.\nMadani may refer to:",

With a market share of 43%, it is the most popular energy drink brand as of 2020, and the third most valuable soft drink brand, behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Since its launch in 1987, more than 100 billion cans of Red Bull have been sold worldwide, including over 12 billion in 2023.\nOriginally available only in a single nondescript flavour sold in a tall and slim silver and blue can, called Red Bull Energy Drink, the drink added numerous variants over time. Its slogan, \"Red Bull Gives You Wings\", is considered one of the most popular and memorable advertising slogans in the world. Rather than following a traditional marketing approach, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a \"brand myth\" through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and standout stunts such as the Stratos space diving project. In addition to sport series, its marketing includes multiple sports team ownerships; celebrity endorsements; and music, through its Red Bull Records label.\nRed Bull was derived from a similar drink called Krating Daeng which originated in Thailand and was introduced by the pharmacist Chaleo Yoovidhya. While doing business in Thailand, Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz purchased a can of Krating Daeng and claimed it cured his jet lag. Mateschitz sought to create a partnership with Yoovidhya and formulated a product that would suit the tastes of Westerners, such as by carbonating the drink. In 1984, the two founded Red Bull GmbH in Fuschl am See, Salzburg, Austria. When branding their new product, Mateschitz referenced Krating Daeng's name: in Thai, daeng means red, and a krating (known in English as a gaur) is a large species of wild bovine native to the Indian subcontinent. Red Bull and Krating Daeng use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market their drinks separately in the Thai and Western markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeise is a surname, meaning \"wise\" or \"prudent\" in German. \nNotable people with the name include:",

He however, initially for many years, stood in opposition to research done by Alice Stewart which connected radiation exposure of pregnant mothers to development of leukaemia in their children due to her 'questionable' analysis. On 28 June 2012, he was the subject of an episode of The New Elizabethans, a series broadcast on BBC Radio Four to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, dealing with 60 public figures from her reign.\n\n\n\nSir William Richard Shaboe Doll  (28 October 1912 \u2013 24 July 2005) was a British physician who became an epidemiologist in the mid-20th century and made important contributions to that discipline.

Both are derived from the old French \"Sieur\" (Lord), brought to England by the French-speaking Normans, and which now exist in French only as part of \"Monsieur\", with the equivalent \"My Lord\" in English. \nTraditionally, as governed by law and custom, Sir is used for men who are knights and belong to certain orders of chivalry, as well as later applied to baronets and other offices. \nAs the female equivalent for knighthood is damehood, the suo jure female equivalent term is typically Dame. The wife of a knight or baronet tends to be addressed as Lady, although a few exceptions and interchanges of these uses exist.\nAdditionally, since the late modern period, Sir has been used as a respectful way to address a man of superior social status or military rank. Equivalent terms of address for women are Madam (shortened to Ma'am), in addition to social honorifics such as Mrs, Ms, or Miss.\nRichard is a male given name. It originates, via Old French, from Old Frankish and is a compound of the words descending from Proto-Germanic *r\u012bk- 'ruler, leader, king' and *hardu- 'strong, brave, hardy', and it therefore means 'strong in rule'. Nicknames include \"Richie\", \"Dick\", \"Dickon\", \"Dickie\", \"Rich\", \"Rick\", \"Rico\", \"Ricky\", and more.\nRichard is a common English (the name was introduced into England by the Normans), German and French male name. It's also used in many more languages, particularly Germanic, such as Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, and Dutch, as well as other languages including Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Finnish. Richard is cognate with variants of the name in other European languages, such as the Swedish \"Rickard\", the Portuguese and Spanish \"Ricardo\" and the Italian \"Riccardo\" (see comprehensive variant list below).\nA doll is a model typically of a human or humanoid character, often used as a toy for children. Dolls have also been used in traditional religious rituals throughout the world. Traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, from the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles.\nMit or MIT may refer to:\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nMit (butterfly), a genus of butterflies in the subtribe Moncina\nEiner may refer to:\n\n11728 Einer, a main-belt asteroid\nHans Einer (1856\u20131927), an Estonian teacher, author and public figure\nLauri Einer (born 1931), Estonian politician\nWies may refer to:",

The team plays its home games at the Estadio Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla, which seats 27,846 spectators. Valladolid's honours include a single trophy of great relevance, the defunct Copa de la Liga 1983\u201384. It has been runner-up in the Copa del Rey on two occasions (1949\u201350 and 1988\u201389), and has participated in two editions of the UEFA Cup (1984\u201385 and 1997\u201398) and also one edition of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (1989\u201390). The team subsidiary, the Real Valladolid Promesas, currently play in the Segunda Federaci\u00f3n.\nSince its La Liga debut in the 1948\u201349 season (in which it became the first club from the region to play in La Liga \u2013 five others have since done so), Valladolid is the most successful football club in Castile and Le\u00f3n by honours and history, with a total of 47 seasons in the First Division, 36 in the Second and 10 in the Third. Historically, Valladolid is the 13th-best team in Spain by overall league points. Two of its players have won the Pichichi Trophy: Manuel Badenes and Jorge da Silva; and ten were internationals with the Spain national football team. In the 21st century, the club's domestic performance follows a yo-yo club pattern, with multiple promotions to (and relegations from) the first division.\nOn 3 September 2018, it was announced that Brazilian former international footballer Ronaldo Nazario had become the majority shareholder after purchasing a 51% controlling stake in the club. As of June 2024, Ronaldo is owner of 82% of the club shares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSantos is a Spanish, Portuguese and Galician surname with several variations. The English translation of Santos is Saints. A singular version, Santo, may occur. Origin: Christian, from Latin sanctus.\nOther Iberian forms include: De Santo, De Santos, Del Santo, Santi, Santis, Santiz, Senti, Sentis and others. Notable individuals with the surname Santos include:\n\n\n",

        "combined_context": "\n\n\n\nBleeding Kansas, Bloody Kansas, or the Border War, was a series of violent civil confrontations in Kansas Territory, and to a lesser extent in western Missouri, between 1854 and 1859. It emerged from a political and ideological debate over the legality of slavery in the proposed state of Kansas.\nThe conflict was characterized by years of electoral fraud, raids, assaults, and murders carried out in the Kansas Territory and neighboring Missouri by proslavery \"border ruffians\" and retaliatory raids carried out by antislavery \"free-staters\". According to Kansapedia of the Kansas Historical Society, 56 political killings were documented during the period, and the total may be as high as 200. It has been called a Tragic Prelude, or an overture, to the American Civil War, which immediately followed it.\nThe conflict centered on the question of whether Kansas, upon gaining statehood, would join the Union as a slave state or a free state. The question was of national importance because Kansas's two new senators would affect the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, which was bitterly divided over the issue of slavery. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854 called for popular sovereignty: the decision about slavery would be made by popular vote of the territory's settlers rather than by legislators in Washington, D.C. Existing sectional tensions surrounding slavery quickly found focus in Kansas.\nMissouri, a slave state since 1821, was populated by many settlers with Southern sympathies and pro-slavery views, some of whom tried to influence the Kansas decision by entering Kansas and claiming to be residents. The conflict was fought politically, and between civilians, where it eventually degenerated into brutal gang violence and paramilitary guerrilla warfare.\nKansas had a state-level civil war that would soon be replicated on a national basis. It had two different capitals (proslavery Lecompton and antislavery Lawrence, then Topeka), two different constitutions (the proslavery Lecompton Constitution and the antislavery Topeka Constitution), and two different legislatures (the so-called \"bogus legislature\" in Lecompton and the antislavery body in Lawrence). Both sides sought and received help from outside, the proslavery side from the federal government: Presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan openly helped the proslavery partisans. Both claimed to reflect the will of the people of Kansas. The proslavers used violence and threats of violence, and the free-soilers responded in kind. After much commotion, including a congressional investigation, it became clear that a majority of Kansans wanted Kansas to be a free state, but this required congressional approval, which Southerners in Congress blocked.\nKansas was admitted to the Union as a free state the same day that enough Southern senators had departed, during the secession crisis that led to the Civil War, to allow it to pass (effective January 29, 1861). Partisan violence continued along the Kansas\u2013Missouri border for most of the war, although Union control of Kansas was never seriously threatened. Bleeding Kansas demonstrated that armed conflict over slavery was unavoidable. Its severity made national headlines, which suggested to the American people that the sectional disputes were unlikely to be resolved without bloodshed, and it, therefore, acted as a preface to the American Civil War. The episode is commemorated with numerous memorials and historic sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamur (French: [namy\u0281] ; Walloon: Nameur; Dutch: Namen [\u02c8na\u02d0m\u0259(n)] ) is a city and municipality in Wallonia, Belgium. It is the capital both of the province of Namur and of Wallonia, hosting the Parliament of Wallonia, the Government of Wallonia and its administration.\nNamur stands at the confluence of the rivers Sambre and Meuse and straddles three different regions \u2013 Hesbaye to the north, Condroz to the south-east, and Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse to the south-west. The city of Charleroi is located to the west. The language spoken is French.\nThe municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Beez, Belgrade, Boninne, Bouge, Champion, Cognel\u00e9e, Daussoulx, Dave, Erpent, Flawinne, Gelbress\u00e9e, Jambes, Lives-sur-Meuse, Loyers, Malonne, Marche-les-Dames, Namur proper, Naninne, Saint-Servais, Saint-Marc, Suarl\u00e9e, Temploux, Vedrin, W\u00e9pion, and Wierde.",

        "combined_context": "A coloring book (British English: colouring-in book, colouring book, or colouring page) is a type of book containing line art to which people are intended to add color using crayons, colored pencils, marker pens, paint or other artistic media. Traditional coloring books and coloring pages are printed on paper or card. Some coloring books have perforated edges so their pages can be removed from the books and used as individual sheets. Others may include a story line and so are intended to be left intact. Today, many children's coloring books feature popular characters. They are often used as promotional materials for motion pictures and television. Coloring books may also incorporate other activities such as connect the dots, mazes and other puzzles. Some also incorporate the use of stickers.\n\n\nChancelor Johnathan Bennett (born April 16, 1993), known professionally as Chance the Rapper, is an American rapper. Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, he released his debut mixtape 10 Day (2012) during one of his high school suspensions. He gained mainstream recognition in 2013 following the release of his second mixtape, Acid Rap. His third mixtape, Coloring Book (2016), was released to further critical acclaim and commercial success, peaking at number eight on the Billboard 200. At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, Bennett won Best New Artist and the mixtape became the first streaming-only album to win a Grammy Award\u2014Best Rap Album\u2014while it spawned the single \"No Problem\" (featuring 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne), which won Best Rap Performance. His debut studio album, The Big Day (2019), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and saw moderate critical reception.\nIn addition to his solo career, Bennett is a member of the Chicago-based collective Savemoney, and is a lead vocalist for the hip hop band the Social Experiment, led by trumpeter Nico Segal. The band released their album Surf in 2015. Bennett has since been prolific in social activism and philanthropic endeavors in his hometown.\n\n\n\nDas Album (\"The Album\") is a collaborative studio album by German singers Thomas Anders and Florian Silbereisen. It was released by Telamo Musik on 5 June 2020 in German-speaking Europe. Produced by Anders' longtime contributor Christian Geller, the album peaked at number-one in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.\n\nAn album is a collection of audio recordings (e.g., music) issued on a medium such as compact disc (CD), vinyl (record), audio tape (like 8-track or cassette), or digital. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records (78s) collected in a bound book resembling a photo album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records played at 33+1\u20443 rpm.\nThe album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century, a period known as the album era. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983, being gradually supplanted by the cassette tape throughout the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s before sharply declining during the 1990s. The cassette had largely disappeared by the first decade of the 2000s.\nMost albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or \"mixed\" together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed \"live\", even when done in a studio. Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some \"live rooms\", have reverberation, which creates a \"live\" sound. Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track.\nAlbum covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos. Historically, the term \"album\" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. In musical usage, the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later, collections of related 78s were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). When LP records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an \"album\"; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.\nColoring or colouring may refer to:\n\nColor, or the act of changing the color of an object\nColoring, the act of adding color to the pages of a coloring book\nColoring, the act of adding color to comic book pages, where the person's job title is Colorist\nGraph coloring, in mathematics\nHair coloring\nFood coloring\nHand-colouring of photographs\nMap coloring\nA book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images. Modern books are typically in codex format, composed of many pages that are bound together and protected by a cover; they were preceded by several earlier formats, including the scroll and the tablet. The book publishing process is the series of steps involved in their creation and dissemination.\nAs a conceptual object, a book refers to a written work of substantial length, which may be distributed either physically or digitally as an ebook. These works can be broadly classified into fiction (containing invented content, often narratives) and non-fiction (containing content intended as factual truth). A physical book may not contain such a work: for example, it may contain only drawings, engravings, photographs, puzzles, or removable content like paper dolls. It may also be left empty for personal use, as in the case of account books, appointment books, autograph books, notebooks, diaries and sketchbooks.\nBooks are sold at both regular stores and specialized bookstores, as well as online for delivery, and can be borrowed from libraries. The reception of books has led to a number of social consequences, including censorship.\nThe modern book industry has seen several major changes due to new technologies, including ebooks and audiobooks (recordings of books being read aloud). Awareness of the needs of print-disabled people has led to a rise in formats designed for greater accessibility, such as braille printing and large-print editions. Google Books estimated in 2010 that approximately 130 million total unique books had been published.\nRapping (also rhyming, flowing, spitting, emceeing, or MCing) is an artistic form of vocal delivery and emotive expression that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and [commonly] street vernacular\". It is usually performed over a backing beat or musical accompaniment. The components of rap include \"content\" (what is being said, e.g., lyrics), \"flow\" (rhythm, rhyme), and \"delivery\" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed off-time to musical accompaniment. It also differs from singing, which varies in pitch and does not always include words. Because they do not rely on pitch inflection, some rap artists may play with timbre or other vocal qualities. Rap is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, and so commonly associated with the genre that it is sometimes called \"rap music\".\nPrecursors to modern rap music include the West African griot tradition, certain vocal styles of blues and jazz, an African-American insult game called playing the dozens (see Battle rap and Diss), and 1960s African-American poetry. Stemming from the hip-hop cultural movement, rap music originated in the Bronx, New York City, in the early 1970s and became part of popular music later that decade. Rapping developed from the announcements made over the microphone at parties by DJs and MCs, evolving into more complex lyrical performances.\nRap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, or beatboxer when performing live. Much less commonly a rapper can decide to perform a cappella, meaning without accompaniment of any sort. When a rap or hip-hop artist is creating a song, \"track\", or record, done primarily in a production studio, most frequently a producer provides the beat(s) for the MC to flow over. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant \"to lightly strike\", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word has been used in the English language since the 16th century. In the 1960s the word became a slang term meaning \"to converse\" in African American vernacular, and very soon after that came to denote the musical style. The word \"rap\" is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.\nRap music has played a significant role in expressing social and political issues, addressing topics such as racism, poverty, and political oppression. By the 21st century, rap had become a global phenomenon, influencing music, fashion, and culture worldwide.\n\nPreis is a surname. Notable people with the surname include:\n\nAlfred Preis (1911\u20131993), Austrian architect\nEllen Preis (Ellen M\u00fcller-Preis) (1912\u20132007), German-born Austrian Olympic champion foil fencer\nMary Louise Preis (born 1941), US politician\nDoug Preis, American voice actor\nAlexander Preys (1905\u20131942), Russian playwright\nChance may refer to:\n\nThe term von ([f\u0254n] ) is used in German surnames either as a nobiliary particle indicating a noble patrilineality, or as a simple preposition used by commoners that means 'of' or 'from'.\nNobility directories like the Almanach de Gotha often abbreviate the noble term von to v. In medieval or early modern names, the von particle was at times added to commoners' names; thus, Hans von Duisburg meant 'Hans from [the city of] Duisburg'. This meaning is preserved in Swiss toponymic surnames and in the Dutch van, which is a cognate of von but also does not necessarily indicate nobility.\n\nDas or DAS may refer to:",

It is 414 kilometres (257 mi) long, with a drainage basin of 10,100 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi). The average discharge is 40 cubic metres per second (1,400 cu ft/s). The river has its sources on the eastern slopes of the Ural Mountains, east of Verkhny Tagil. From there, the Tagil flows north towards Nizhny Tagil, and then in a northeasterly direction to its confluence with the Tura.\nThe Salda is a southern tributary. A northern tributary, the Barancha, was probably used by Yermak Timofeyevich on his way to capture the Khanate of Sibir.\n\n",

The peninsula is considered the dividing point between the Norwegian Sea to the north and the North Sea to the south.  The name is sometimes also written as Stadt, Statt, or Statlandet (not to be confused with the similar German word Stadt), because the Norwegian pronunciation of the d in this case is as a t. The name could be translated as \"the land of places\" or \"the land of towns\". Some of the larger villages on the peninsula include Ervik (northwestern tip), Borgundv\u00e5g and Leikanger (northeastern side), and the village of Selje (southwestern side).\nToru\u0144 is a city on the Vistula River in north-central Poland and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its population was 196,935 as of December 2021. Previously, it was the capital of the Toru\u0144 Voivodeship (1975\u20131998) and the Pomeranian Voivodeship (1921\u20131945). Since 1999, Toru\u0144 has been a seat of the local government of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship and is one of its two capitals, together with Bydgoszcz. The cities and neighboring counties form the Bydgoszcz\u2013Toru\u0144 twin city metropolitan area.\nToru\u0144 is one of the oldest cities in Poland; it was first settled in the 8th century and in 1233 was expanded by the Teutonic Knights. For centuries it was home to people of diverse backgrounds and religions.  From 1264 until 1411, Toru\u0144 was part of the Hanseatic League and by the 17th century a leading trading point, which greatly affected the city's architecture, ranging from Brick Gothic to Mannerist and Baroque.\nIn the Early Modern period, Toru\u0144 was a royal city of Poland and one of Poland's four largest cities. With the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, it became part of Prussia, then of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, serving as the temporary Polish capital in 1809, then again of Prussia, of the German Empire and, after World War I, of the reborn Polish Republic. During the Second World War, Toru\u0144 was spared bombing and destruction; its Old Town and iconic central marketplace have been entirely preserved.\nToru\u0144 is renowned for its gingerbread \u2013 the gingerbread-baking tradition dates back nearly a millennium \u2013 as well as for its large Cathedral. It hosts the Camerimage International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography. Toru\u0144 is noted for its very high standard of living and quality of life. In 1997 the medieval part of the city was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2007 the Old Town of Toru\u0144 was added to the list of Seven Wonders of Poland.\n\n\"Warum\" (English: \"Why\") is a song by German band Juli. It was written by band members Simon Triebel and Eva Briegel and produced by O.L.A.F. Opal for their debut album Es ist Juli (2004).

Welche, Welsh and English are all distantly related through the Indo-European group and language-mixing.\n",

It is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's nearly 9 million people are concentrated on the plateau, which hosts its largest cities and economic centres, including Zurich, Geneva, and Lausanne. \nSwitzerland is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern. It has four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Although most Swiss are German-speaking, national identity is fairly cohesive, being rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and Alpine symbolism. Swiss identity transcends language, ethnicity, and religion, leading to Switzerland being described as a Willensnation (\"nation of volition\") rather than a nation state.\nSwitzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle Ages as a defensive and commercial alliance; the Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. The confederation steadily expanded and consolidated despite external threats and internal political and religious strife. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The confederation was among the first and few republics of the early modern period, and the only one besides San Marino to survive the Napoleonic Wars. \nSwitzerland remained a network of self-governing states until 1798, when revolutionary France invaded and imposed the centralist Helvetic Republic. Napoleon abolished the republic in 1803 and reinstated a confederation. Following the Napoleonic Wars (1803\u20131815), Switzerland restored its pre-revolutionary system, but by 1830 faced growing division and conflict between liberal and conservative movements; this culminated in a new constitution in 1848 that established the current federal system and enshrined principles such as individual rights, separation of powers, and parliamentary bicameralism. \nSwitzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality since the 16th century and has not fought an international war since 1815. It joined the United Nations only in 2002 but pursues an active foreign policy that includes frequent involvement in peace building and global governance. Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross and hosts the headquarters or offices of most major international institutions, including the WTO, the WHO, the ILO, FIFA, the WEF, and the UN. It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) but not part of the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area, or the eurozone; however, it participates in the European single market and the Schengen Area. \nSwitzerland is among the world's most developed countries, with the highest nominal wealth per adult and the eighth-highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. It performs highly on several international metrics, including economic competitiveness, democratic governance, and press freedom.

SD, historically romanized as Sind) is a province of Pakistan. Located in the southeastern region of the country, Sindh is the third-largest province of Pakistan by land area and the second-largest province by population after Punjab. It is bordered by the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan to the west and north-west and Punjab to the north. It shares an International border with the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east; it is also bounded by the Arabian Sea to the south. Sindh's landscape consists mostly of alluvial plains flanking the Indus River, the Thar Desert in the eastern portion of the province along the international border with India, and the Kirthar Mountains in the western portion of the province.\nThe economy of Sindh is the second largest in Pakistan after the province of Punjab; its provincial capital Karachi is the most populous city in the country as well as its main financial hub. Sindh is home to a large portion of Pakistan's industrial sector and contains two of the country's busiest commercial seaports: Port Qasim and the Port of Karachi. The remainder of Sindh consists of an agriculture-based economy and produces fruits, consumer items and vegetables for other parts of the country.\nSindh is sometimes referred to as the Bab-ul Islam (transl.\u2009'Gateway of Islam'), as it was one of the first regions of the Indian subcontinent to fall under Islamic rule. The province is well known for its distinct culture, which is strongly influenced by Sufist Islam, an important marker of Sindhi identity for both Hindus and Muslims.

The city has an estimated population of 1,618,879 as of the 2011 census and distributed over 310 km2 (120 sq mi), making Ludhiana the most densely populated urban centre in the state. It is a major industrial center of Northern India, referred to as \"India's Manchester\" by the BBC. It is also known as the commercial capital of Punjab.\nIt stands on the old bank of Sutlej River, that is now 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) to the south of its present course. The Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has placed Ludhiana on the 48th position among the top 100 smart cities, and the city has been ranked as one of the easiest cities in India for business according to the World Bank.\n\n\nStad or Stadlandet is a peninsula in Stad Municipality in the northwestern part of the Nordfjord district in Vestland county in Norway.  The peninsula is considered the dividing point between the Norwegian Sea to the north and the North Sea to the south.

With a population of 409,549 as of 2022 in the city core and 658,550 in the governorate, Khobar is part of the 'Triplet Cities' area, or Dammam metropolitan area along with Dammam and Dhahran, forming the residential core of the region.\nThe city was founded alongside Dammam by the Dawasir who moved there in 1923 fearing British persecution with the permission of King Abdulaziz Al Saud. Khobar experienced rapid growth during and after the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia as it served as the port for the oil exports of Saudi Aramco in the company's early days. Traditionally, Khobar has also been a city of shopkeepers and merchants, and today has several shopping malls in and around it.\nThe city is the newest in the Dammam metropolitan area, facing the Persian Gulf with its 16-km long Corniche Road, which runs parallel to the city's eastern coast. Khobar is also considered a resort town as its southern suburbs of the city face the Half Moon Bay and host several beaches and beach resorts. By night, the quiet city turns into a bustling one, with some of the largest malls in the kingdom, such as the Mall of Dhahran and the al-Rashid Mall. The city is also home to the historic Suwaiket Street, officially known as Prince Bandar ibn Abdulaziz Street, which is home to some of the oldest markets in the city. The same could also be said about King Khalid Street and Prince Mohammed Street.\nThe Khobar governorate is further divided into several municipalities, with Khobar as their capital. 'Issam ibn Abdullatif al-Mulla has been serving as the mayor of the governorate since the Islamic year 1428 AH (2007 CE).\nWER or Wer may refer to:\n\nWer (god), an Akkadian god\nWer (film), a 2013 horror film\nWere, an archaic term for adult men\nWeak echo region, in meteorology, an area of markedly lower reflectivity within thunderstorms resulting from an increase in updraft strength\nWerribee railway station, Melbourne\nWestern Entrance to the Riedbahn, the western approach of the Riedbahn in Mannheim, Germany\nWiki Educational Resources Limited, the legal name of the first Wikimedia UK chapter\nWindows Error Reporting, a feature of Windows XP and later operating systems\nWord error rate, in computational linguistics, a common metric of measuring the performance of a speech recognition system\n\n\nDer or DER may refer to:",

Posey County is part of the Evansville, Indiana metropolitan statistical area. The Ports of Indiana-Mount Vernon, on the Ohio River, is the seventh-largest inland port complex in the nation. Mechanization of dock technology has altered the number of workers at the port, but Posey County is still the seventh-largest internal port in the United States, based on the tons of materials handled. Grain from the Midwest is among the products shipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJahr (Persian: \u062c\u0647\u0631) is a village in Anduhjerd Rural District of Shahdad District, Kerman County, Kerman province, Iran.\n\nPosey may refer to:\nA county (Latin: comitatus) is a geographic region of a country used for administrative or other purposes in some nations. The term is derived from the Old French comt\u00e9  denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or, in his stead, a viscount (vicomte). Literal equivalents in other languages, derived from the equivalent of \"count\", are now seldom used officially, including comt\u00e9, contea, contado, comtat, condado, Grafschaft, graafschap, and zhupa in Slavic languages; terms equivalent to 'commune' or 'community' are now often instead used.\nWhen the Normans conquered England, they brought the term with them. Although there were at first no counts, vicomtes or counties in Anglo-Norman England, the earlier Anglo-Saxons did have earls, sheriffs and shires. The shires were the districts that became the historic counties of England, and given the same Latin translation comitatus. Many English county names derive from the name of the county town (county seat) with the word shire added on, for example Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. The term \"county\" evolved to designate a level of local administration that was immediately beneath a national government, within a unitary (non-federal) system of government. \"County\" later also became used differently in some federal systems of government, for a local administrative division subordinate to a primary subnational entity, such as a Province (e.g. Canada) or a level 3 territorial unit such as NUTS 3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics \u2013 Level 3).\nExamples include the United States and Canada, which evolved from British colonial North America and inherited British governmental traditions, where counties often remain as local administrative divisions that evolved from historic (pre-federal) counties governed by courts/magistracy.\nA county may be further subdivided into smaller jurisdictions such as hundreds, or townships. A county usually, but not always, contains cities, towns, townships, villages, or other municipal corporations, which in most cases are somewhat subordinate or dependent upon county governments. Depending on the nation, municipality, and local geography, municipalities may or may not be subject to direct or indirect county control.\u2009The functions of both levels are often consolidated into a city government when the area is densely populated, and are generally not when it is less densely populated.\nOutside English-speaking countries, an equivalent of the term county is often used to describe subnational jurisdictions that are structurally equivalent to counties in the relationship they have with their national government; but which may not be administratively equivalent to counties in predominantly English-speaking countries.\n\nIndiana (  IN-dee-AN-\u0259) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. It borders Lake Michigan to the northwest, Michigan to the north and northeast, Ohio to the east, the Ohio River and Kentucky to the south and southeast, and the Wabash River and Illinois to the west. Nicknamed \"the Hoosier State\", Indiana is the 38th-largest by area and the 17th-most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Indianapolis. Indiana was admitted to the Union as the 19th state on December 11, 1816. \nVarious indigenous peoples inhabited what would become Indiana for thousands of years, some of whom the U.S. government expelled between 1800 and 1836. Indiana received its name because the state was largely possessed by native tribes even after it was granted statehood. Since then, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York, Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Upland South, particularly Kentucky and Tennessee.\nIndiana has a diverse economy with a gross state product of $352.62 billion in 2021. It has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller cities and towns. Indiana is home to professional sports teams, including the NFL's Indianapolis Colts the NBA's Indiana Pacers, and the WNBA's Indiana Fever. The state also hosts several notable competitive events, such as the Indianapolis 500, held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\nAUS or Aus may refer to:",

In particular, he is linked to the cyberpunk subgenre.\nSterling's first science-fiction story, \"Man-Made Self\", was sold in 1976.  He is the author of science-fiction novels, including Schismatrix (1985), Islands in the Net (1988), and Heavy Weather (1994). In 1992, he published his first non-fiction book, The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier.\nHe has been interviewed for documentaries such as Freedom Downtime, TechnoCalyps and Traceroute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSterling may refer to:\n\nHonorifics are words that connote esteem or respect when used in addressing or referring to a person. In the German language, honorifics distinguish people by age, sex, profession, academic achievement, and rank. In the past, a distinction was also made between married and unmarried women.\nThe English language name Bruce arrived in Scotland with the Normans, from the place name Brix, Manche in Normandy, France, meaning \"the willowlands\". Initially promulgated via the descendants of king Robert the Bruce (1274\u22121329), it has been a Scottish surname since medieval times; it is now a common male given name.\nThe variant Lebrix and Le Brix are French variations of the surname.\nNote: A few people are notable in more than one field, and therefore appear in more than one section.\nWie or WIE may refer to:\n\nY, the twenty-fifth letter of the Latin alphabet, pronounced wie\n\nDie, as a verb, refers to death, the cessation of life. \nDie may also refer to:\nThe term von ([f\u0254n] ) is used in German surnames either as a nobiliary particle indicating a noble patrilineality, or as a simple preposition used by commoners that means 'of' or 'from'.\nNobility directories like the Almanach de Gotha often abbreviate the noble term von to v. In medieval or early modern names, the von particle was at times added to commoners' names; thus, Hans von Duisburg meant 'Hans from [the city of] Duisburg'. This meaning is preserved in Swiss toponymic surnames and in the Dutch van, which is a cognate of von but also does not necessarily indicate nobility.",

Neighboring districts are Herford, Minden-L\u00fcbbecke, H\u00f6xter, Paderborn, G\u00fctersloh, and district-free Bielefeld, which forms the region  Ostwestfalen-Lippe.\nThe district of Lippe is named after the Lords of Lippe, who originally lived on the river Lippe and founded Lippstadt there, and their Principality of Lippe. It was a state within the Holy Roman Empire and retained statehood until 1947, when it became a district of North Rhine-Westphalia.\nWann may refer to:\n\nWann, Nebraska\nWann, Oklahoma\nWANN-CD, a television station based in Atlanta, Georgia\nWANN, the former call sign of radio station WBIS in Baltimore, Maryland\nWann Formation, a geologic formation in Kansas and Oklahoma\nUSS Walter C. Wann, a US Navy ship during World War II\nWann River, a tributary of Tagish Lake in northern Canada\nWe Are Not Numbers (WANN), English-language writing workshops for Palestinians in Gaza\n\n\nZur occurs five times in the King James Bible as the name of various people and a state.\n\nThe first mention is in Numbers 25:15. This is the pericope where Numbers 25:1 tells us that Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab(Patriarch of Moab):\nAnd the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.\nThe second mention is Numbers 31:8\u201331:9. Here, the nation of Israel is warring against the Midianites, and a body-count is given:\nAnd they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.\nAnd the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.\nThe third mention is a recapitulation of the second, at the pericope of Joshua's death-scene, Joshua 13:21:\nAnd all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur , and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.\nThe fourth mention is in the begats at 1 Chronicles 8:30:\nAnd his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab\nThe fifth mention is about the servers at the temple, 1 Chronicles 9:35\u20139:36:\nAnd in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:\nAnd his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab.",

The stadium is 22 miles (35 km) southwest of downtown Boston, Massachusetts and 18 miles (29 km) northeast of Providence, Rhode Island. It serves as the home stadium and administrative offices for both the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) and the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer (MLS). It opened in 2002, replacing the adjacent Foxboro Stadium. It also served as the home venue for the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Minutemen football team in 2012 and 2013, while on-campus Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium underwent renovations; it continued to serve as a part-time home venue for higher attendance UMass games through 2018. Gillette Stadium's seating capacity is 64,628, including 5,876 club seats and 82 luxury suites.\nThe town of Foxborough approved plans for the stadium's construction on December 6, 1999, and work on the stadium began on March 24, 2000. The first official event at the stadium was an MLS soccer game on May 11, 2002, where the New England Revolution defeated Dallas Burn, 2\u20130. Jeremiah Freed was the opening band at the WBCN River Rave on June 9, making them the first band to play at the stadium. Grand opening ceremonies were held on September 9, when the Patriots unveiled their Super Bowl XXXVI championship banner before a Monday Night Football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The stadium was originally known as CMGI Field before the naming rights were bought by Gillette after the \"dot-com\" bust. Although Gillette was acquired by Procter & Gamble in 2005, the stadium retains the Gillette name. In September 2010, Gillette and the Patriots announced that their partnership, which includes naming rights to the stadium, would extend through the 2031 season. Additionally, uBid (a wholly owned subsidiary of CMGI until 2003) continued to sponsor one of the main entrance gates to the stadium.\nGillette Stadium is served by special MBTA Commuter Rail service from Boston and Providence during events, plus regular weekday service via the Franklin/Foxboro Line, at Foxboro station. The Patriots have sold out every home game since moving to the stadium\u2014preseason, regular season, and playoffs. This streak dates back to the 1994 season at Foxboro Stadium; by September 2016, it had reached 231 games. The stadium is owned and operated by Kraft Sports Group, a subsidiary of the Kraft Group, the company through which businessman Robert Kraft owns the Patriots and Revolution.\nThe stadium is set to host several matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Due to FIFA rules regarding stadium sponsorships, Gillette will be known as Boston Stadium for the tournament, in reference to the Greater Boston area the stadium sits on.\n\n\n\n\nFoxborough is a town in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States. Located in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, it is about 22 miles (35 km) southwest of Boston. The population was 18,618 at the 2020 census.\n\"Foxborough\" is the official spelling of the town name per local government, but the abbreviated spelling \"Foxboro\" is common and is used by the United States Postal Service.\nFoxborough is best known as the site of Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) and the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer (MLS).\n\nPlatz may refer to:\nGillette is an American brand of safety razors and other personal care products including shaving supplies, owned by the multi-national corporation Procter & Gamble (P&G). Based in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, it was owned by The Gillette Company, a supplier of products under various brands until that company merged into P&G in 2005. The Gillette Company was founded by King C. Gillette in 1901 as a safety razor manufacturer.\nUnder the leadership of Colman M. Mockler Jr. as CEO from 1975 to 1991, the company was the target of multiple takeover attempts from Ronald Perelman and Coniston Partners. In January 2005, Procter & Gamble announced plans to merge with the Gillette Company.\nThe Gillette Company's assets were incorporated into a P&G unit known internally as \"Global Gillette\". In July 2007, Global Gillette was dissolved and incorporated into Procter & Gamble's other two main divisions, Procter & Gamble Beauty and Procter & Gamble Household Care. Gillette's brands and products were divided between the two accordingly.  The Gillette R&D center in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Gillette South Boston Manufacturing Center (known as \"Gillette World Shaving Headquarters\"), still exist as functional working locations under the Procter & Gamble-owned Gillette brand name. Gillette's subsidiaries Braun and Oral-B, among others, have also been retained by P&G.\nA stadium (pl.: stadiums or stadia) is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage completely surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event.\nPausanias noted that for about half a century the only event at the ancient Greek Olympic festival was the race that comprised one length of the stadion at Olympia, where the word \"stadium\" originated.\nMost of the stadiums with a capacity of at least 10,000 are used for association football. Other popular stadium sports include gridiron football, baseball, cricket, the various codes of rugby, field lacrosse, bandy, and bullfighting. Many large sports venues are also used for concerts.\nWie or WIE may refer to:\n\nY, the twenty-fifth letter of the Latin alphabet, pronounced wie\nViele or Viel\u00e9 may refer to any one of the following:\nHaben is a surname.
